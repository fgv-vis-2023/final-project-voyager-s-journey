Exaggerated Color East of the Great Red Spot,1996-01-29,PIA00020,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00020,This view of the region just to the east of the Red Spot is seen in greatly exaggerated color. The colors do not represent the true hues seen in the Jovian atmosphere but have been produced by special computer processing to enhance subtle variations in both color and shading.

Cylindrical Projection of Jupiter,1979-02-01,PIA00011,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00011,"This computer generated map of Jupiter was made from 10 color images of Jupiter taken Feb. 1, 1979, by Voyager 1, during a single, 10 hour rotation of the planet. Computers at Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Image Processing Lab then turned the photos into this cylindrical projection. Such a projection is invaluable as an instantaneous view of the entire planet. Along the northern edge of the north equatorial belt (NEB) are four dark brown, oblong regions believed by some scientists to be openings in the more colorful upper cloud decks, allowing the darker clouds beneath to be seen. The broad equatorial zone (EZ) is dominated by a series of plumes, possibly regions of intense convective activity, encircling the entire planet. In the southern hemisphere the Great Red Spot is located at about 75 degrees longitude. South of the Great Red Spot in the south temperate zone (STeZ) three large white ovals, seen from Earth-based observatories for the past few decades, are located at 5 degrees, 85 degrees and 170 degrees longitude. Resolution in this map is 375 miles (600 kilometers). Since Jupiter's atmospheric features drift around the planet, longitude is based on the orientation of the planet's magnetic field. Symbols at right edge of photo denote major atmospheric features (dark belts and light zones): NTeZ - north temperate zone; NTrZ - north tropical zone; NEB - north equatorial belt; EZ - equatorial zone; SEB - south equatorial belt; STrZ - south tropical zone; and STeZ - south temperate zone. Voyager belt; EZ - equatorial zone; SEB - south tropical zone."
Galilean Satellites,1996-01-29,PIA00012,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00012,"These photos of the four Galilean satellites of Jupiter were taken by Voyager 1 during its approach to the planet in early March 1979. Io (top left), Europa (top right), Ganymede (bottom left) and Callisto (bottom right) are shown in their correct relative sizes: Ganymede and Callisto are both larger than the planet Mercury; Io and Europa are about the same size as the Moon. Image processing also preserves the relative contrasts of the satellites. Thus it is apparent that Europa has the least contrast; Io the greatest. Io is covered with active volcanoes and a surface composed largely of sulfur. Europa is apparently very different; Voyager 1 did not approach Europa closely enough to show its surface in great detail; that remains for Voyager 2. Ganymede and Callisto are both composed mostly of water and water ice; they have large quantities of ice exposed on their surfaces. The Io photo was taken from 1.7 million miles (2.9 million kilometers); Europa, 1.7 million miles (2.9 million kilometers); Ganymede, 2 million miles (3.4 million kilometers); and Callisto, 4.1 million miles (6.9 million kilometers). Resolution of all photos except Callisto is about 30 miles (50 kilometers), and for Callisto it is 60 miles (100 kilometers)."
Large Brown Oval,1979-03-02,PIA00015,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00015,"This large brown oval, photographed on March 2, 1979 by Voyager 1, is located between 13° and 18° N latitude and may be an opening in the upper cloud deck which, if observed at extremely high resolution, could provide information about deeper, warmer cloud levels; therefore, it has been selected as one of the targets to be photographed on March 5 near closest approach to Jupiter. Features of this sort are not rare on Jupiter and have an average lifetime of one to two years. Above the feature is the pale orange North Temperate Belt, bounded on the south by the high speed North Temperate Current with winds of 120 meters/sec (260 mi/hr). The range to Jupiter at the time this photograph was obtained was 4.0 million kilometers (2.5 million miles) with the smallest resolvable features being 75 kilometers (45 miles) wide."
Cloud Layers Southeast of the Great Red Spot,1979-03-04,PIA00017,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00017,"This view of the region just to the Southeast of the Great Red Spot was taken by Voyager 1 on March 4, 1979 at a distance of 1,100,000 miles (1,800,000 km). Differences in cloud color may indicate relative heights of the cloud layers but the exact relationship between color and height has not yet been established. The smallest clouds seen in this picture are approximately 20 miles (30 km) across."
Cloud Layers East of the Great Red Spot,1979-03-04,PIA00019,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00019,"This color view of the region just to the East of the Great Red Spot was taken by Voyager 1 on March 4, 1979 at a distance of 1,000,000 miles (1,800,000 km). Differences in cloud color may indicate relative heights of the cloud layers but the exact relationship between color and height has not yet been established. The smallest clouds seen in this picture are approximately 20 miles (30 km) across."
Saturn With Tethys and Dione,1980-11-03,PIA00024,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00024,"Saturn and two of its moons, Tethys (above) and Dione, were photographed by Voyager 1 on November 3, 1980, from 13 million kilometers (8 million miles). The shadows of Saturn's three bright rings and Tethys are cast onto the cloud tops. The limb of the planet can be seen easily through the 3,500-kilometer-wide (2,170 mile) Cassini Division, which separates ring A from ring B. The view through the much narrower Encke Division, near the outer edge of ring A is less clear. Beyond the Encke Division (at left) is the faintest of Saturn's three bright rings, the C-ring or crepe ring, barely visible against the planet."
Saturn - Brown Ovals in Northern Hemisphere,1980-11-07,PIA00026,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00026,"Two brown ovals, at right, some 10,000 kilometers (6,000 miles) across, were found at approximately 40` and 60` latitude in Saturn's northern hemisphere by Voyager 1. The photo was taken on November 7, 1980, from a range of 7,500,000 kilometers (4,600,000 miles). The polar oval (upper right) has a structure similar to the Saturn red spot located in the southern polar latitudes."
Io - Full Disk,1979-03-04,PIA00023,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00023,"This full-disk image of Jupiter's satellite Io was made from several frames taken by Voyager 1 on March 4, 1979, as the spacecraft neared the satellite. Io is about 862,000 kilometers (500,000 miles) away here. A variety of features can be seen in the photo that appear linked to the intense volcanic activity on Io: the circular, donut-shaped feature in the center has been identified with a known erupting volcano; other, similar features can be seen across the face of the satellite. Io's volcanic activity appears to be of at least two general kinds -- explosive eruptions that spew material into the sky as much as 250 kilometers (160 miles) altitude; and lava that flows from vents across the surface. Io is the first body in the solar system (beyond Earth) where active volcanism has been observed."
Saturn - False Color of Southern Hemisphere,1980-11-06,PIA00025,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00025,"This false-color image of Saturn's southern hemisphere taken by NASA's Voyager 1 on Nov. 6, 1980, shows the unique red oval cloud feature located at 55 degrees south latitude. The photograph was taken by the spacecraft at a distance of 8,500,000 kilometers (5,300,000 miles) from Saturn. The difference in color between the red oval and surrounding bluish clouds indicates that material within the oval contains a substance that absorbs more blue and violet light than the bluish clouds. Voyager imaging team scientists first observed the oval in August 1980, and the feature has seemed to retain its appearance since its discovery."
Jupiter with Satellites Io and Europa,1979-02-13,PIA00144,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00144,"Voyager 1 took this photo of Jupiter and two of its satellites (Io, left, and Europa) on Feb. 13, 1979. Io is about 350,000 kilometers (220,000 miles) above Jupiter's Great Red Spot; Europa is about 600,000 kilometers (375,000 miles) above Jupiter's clouds. Although both satellites have about the same brightness, Io's color is very different from Europa's. Io's equatorial region show two types of material -- dark orange, broken by several bright spots -- producing a mottled appearance. The poles are darker and reddish. Preliminary evidence suggests color variations within and between the polar regions. Io's surface composition is unknown, but scientists believe it may be a mixture of salts and sulfur. Europa is less strongly colored, although still relatively dark at short wavelengths. Markings on Europa are less evident than on the other satellites, although this picture shows darker regions toward the trailing half of the visible disk. Jupiter is about 20 million kilometers (12.4 million miles) from the spacecraft. At this resolution (about 400 kilometers or 250 miles) there is evidence of circular motion in Jupiter's atmosphere. While the dominant large-scale motions are west-to-east, small-scale movement includes eddy-like circulation within and between the bands. This photo was assembled from three black and white negatives by the Image Processing Lab at Jet Propulsion Laboratory."
Jupiter Great Red Spot,1979-02-25,PIA00014,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00014,"This dramatic view of Jupiter's Great Red Spot and its surroundings was obtained by Voyager 1 on Feb. 25, 1979, when the spacecraft was 5.7 million miles (9.2 million kilometers) from Jupiter. Cloud details as small as 100 miles (160 kilometers) across can be seen here. The colorful, wavy cloud pattern to the left of the Red Spot is a region of extraordinarily complex end variable wave motion."
Jupiter with Satellite Io,1979-02-01,PIA00235,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00235,"Voyager 1 took this photo of Jupiter Feb. 1, 1979, at a range of 20 million miles (32.7 million kilometers). Voyager scientists can now see that different colors in clouds around the Great Red Spot imply that the clouds swirl around the spot at varying altitudes. They also observe apparently regular spacing between the small white spots in the southern hemisphere and similar positioning of dark spots in the northern hemisphere. A major activity will be to understand the form and structure of the spots and how they may relate to interactions between the atmospheric composition and its motions. When scientists compare this image with the 6,000 others already taken, they see many changes both large and small. The bright cloud in the equatorial region north of the Great Red Spot, for example, appears to be where bright clouds originate, then stream westward. On the other hand, the bright ovals south of the Great Red Spot were seen to form about 40 years ago, and have remained much the same ever since. The Great Red Spot itself has been observed for hundreds of years though never in the detail seen here. Objects as small as 375 miles (600 kilometers across can be seen in this image. That resolution is the best achieved of Jupiter. This black-and-white photo was taken through blue filter."
Io with Loki Plume on Bright Limb,1996-06-03,PIA00010,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00010,"NASA's Voyager 1 image of Io showing active plume of Loki on limb. Heart-shaped feature southeast of Loki consists of fallout deposits from active plume Pele. The images that make up this mosaic were taken from an average distance of approximately 490,000 kilometers (340,000 miles)."
Ganymede at 2.6 million miles,1996-07-17,PIA00351,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00351,"This photo of Ganymede, largest of Jupiter's Galilean satellites and the third from the planet, was taken shortly after midnight March 1, from a distance of 2.6 million miles (4.2 million kilometers). Ganymede is slightly larger than the planet Mercury, but is much less dense; it has roughly twice the density of water. Ganymede's surface brightness is four times that of Earth's Moon. This photo shows dark features reminiscent of the dark, mare regions on the Moon. On Ganymede, however, these features have twice the brightness of lunar mare. Scientists believe they are unlikely to be composed of rock or lava as the Moon's mare regions are. Ganymede's north polar region appears to be covered with brighter material, and scientists say it could be water frost. Later photos of Ganymede will be taken from closer range and will therefore have higher resolution if those photos of the polar region show underlying terrain blanketed by frost, it could indicate movement of water= across Ganymede's surface, possibly in a very thin atmosphere. Brighter spots are also scattered across this hemisphere of Ganymede. They may be related to impact craters, or may represent source regions of fresh ice."
"Ganymede at 87,000 miles",1979-03-05,PIA00354,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00354,"This picture of Ganymede, Jupiter's largest satellite was taken on the afternoon of March 5, 1979 from a range 145,000 km (87,000 mi). The width of the picture represents about 580 km (548 mi.) on the surface of Ganymede, and the smallest visible features are about 3 km (1.7 mi) across. The picture shows complex patterns of ridges and grooves which are probably the results of deformations of Ganymede's thick icy crust. Some systems of grooves and ridges are superposed on the ridge and groove systems indicating they are younger. A more degraded crater near the left center of the picture is crossed by ridges indicated that it predates the period of crystal deformation."
Ganymede at 3.4 million miles,1979-03-02,PIA00352,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00352,"This color picture of Ganymede, Jupiter's largest satellite, was taken on the afternoon of March 2, 1979, by Voyager 1 from a distance of about 3.4 million kilometers (2.1 million miles). This photograph was assembled from three black-and-white pictures in the Image Processing Laboratory at JPL. This face of Ganymede is centered on the 260° meridian. Ganymede is slightly larger than the planet Mercury but has a density almost three times less than Mercury. Therefore, Ganymede probably consists in large part of ice. At this resolution the surface shows light and dark markings interspersed with bright spots. The large darkish area near the center of the satellite is crossed by irregular light streaks somewhat similar to rays seen on the Moon. The bright patch in the southern hemisphere is reminiscent of some of the larger rayed craters on the Moon caused by meteorite impact."
Callisto Mosaic,1996-08-12,PIA00080,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00080,"Callisto was revealed by the Voyager cameras to be a heavily cratered and hence geologically inactive world. This mosaic of Voyager 1 images, obtained on March 6 from a distance of about 400,000 kilometers, shows surface detail as small as 10 kilometers across. The prominent old impact feature Valhalla has a central bright spot about 600 kilometers across, probably representing the original impact basin. The concentric bright rings extend outward about 1500 kilometers from the impact center."
Jupiter Great Red Spot Mosaic,1996-08-01,PIA00022,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00022,"This photo of Jupiter's Great Red Spot was taken by Voyager 1 in early March 1979. Distance from top to bottom of the picture is 15,000 miles (24,000 kilometers). Smallest features visible are about 20 miles (30 kilometers) across. The white feature below the Great Red Spot is one of several white ovals that were observed to form about 40 years ago; they move around Jupiter at a different velocity from the Red Spot. During the Voyager 1 encounter period, material was observed to revolve around the center of the spot with a period of six days."
Crescent Earth and Moon,1996-08-29,PIA00013,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00013,"This picture of a crescent-shaped Earth and Moon -- the first of its kind ever taken by a spacecraft -- was recorded Sept. 18, 1977, by NASA's Voyager 1 when it was 7.25 million miles (11.66 million kilometers) from Earth. The Moon is at the top of the picture and beyond the Earth as viewed by Voyager. In the picture are eastern Asia, the western Pacific Ocean and part of the Arctic. Voyager 1 was directly above Mt. Everest (on the night side of the planet at 25 degrees north latitude) when the picture was taken. The photo was made from three images taken through color filters, then processed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Image Processing Lab. Because the Earth is many times brighter than the Moon, the Moon was artificially brightened by a factor of three relative to the Earth by computer enhancement so that both bodies would show clearly in the print."
Europa - Full Disk,1979-03-04,PIA00016,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00016,"This picture of Europa, the smallest Galilean satellite, was taken in the afternoon of March 4, 1979, from a distance of about 2 million kilometers (1.2 million miles) by Voyager 1. This face of Europa is centered at about the 300° meridian. The resolution of this picture of Europa is about the best that will be obtained by Voyager 1, but the second spacecraft will take much clearer photographs of this satellite in July. The bright areas are probably ice deposits while the darkened areas may be the rocky surface or areas with a more patchy distribution of ice. The most unusual features are the systems of long linear structures which cross the surface in various directions. Some of these linear structures are over a thousand kilometers long and about 2 or 3 hundred kilometers wide. They may be fractures or faults which have disrupted the surface."
Early Voyager 1 Images of Jupiter,1974-12-03,PIA00454,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00454,"These Jupiter photographs are part of a set taken by Voyager 1 on December 10 and 11, 1978 from a distance of 83 million km (52 million miles) or more than half the distance from the Earth to the sun. At this range, Voyager 1 is able to record more detail on the giant planet than the very best ground-based telescopes. The highest resolution ever obtained on the Jovian disk was recorded by Pioneer 11 four years ago. Voyager, however, has longer focal-length optics than Pioneer, and while nearly three months from encounter (~ March 1979) was able to achieve higher resolution than that obtained by Pioneer only 24 hours from its encounter on 3 December 1974."
Dione Mosaic,1980-11-12,PIA00028,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00028,"Many impact craters -- the record of the collision of cosmic debris -- are shown in this Voyager 1 mosaic of Saturn's moon Dione. The largest crater is less than 100 kilometers (62 miles) in diameter and shows a well-developed central peak. Bright rays represent material ejected from other impact craters. Sinuous valleys probably formed by faults break the moon's icy crust. Images in this mosaic were taken from a range of 162,000 kilometers (100,600 miles) on Nov. 12, 1980."
"Solar System Portrait - View of the Sun, Earth and Venus",1990-02-14,PIA00450,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00450,"This color image of the sun, Earth and Venus was taken by the Voyager 1 spacecraft Feb. 14, 1990, when it was approximately 32 degrees above the plane of the ecliptic and at a slant-range distance of approximately 4 billion miles. It is the first -- and may be the only -- time that we will ever see our solar system from such a vantage point. The image is a portion of a wide-angle image containing the sun and the region of space where the Earth and Venus were at the time with two narrow-angle pictures centered on each planet. The wide-angle was taken with the camera's darkest filter (a methane absorption band), and the shortest possible exposure (5 thousandths of a second) to avoid saturating the camera's vidicon tube with scattered sunlight. The sun is not large in the sky as seen from Voyager's perspective at the edge of the solar system but is still eight million times brighter than the brightest star in Earth's sky, Sirius. The image of the sun you see is far larger than the actual dimension of the solar disk. The result of the brightness is a bright burned out image with multiple reflections from the optics in the camera. The ""rays"" around the sun are a diffraction pattern of the calibration lamp which is mounted in front of the wide angle lens. The two narrow-angle frames containing the images of the Earth and Venus have been digitally mosaiced into the wide-angle image at the appropriate scale. These images were taken through three color filters and recombined to produce a color image. The violet, green and blue filters were used; exposure times were, for the Earth image, 0.72, 0.48 and 0.72 seconds, and for the Venus frame, 0.36, 0.24 and 0.36, respectively. Although the planetary pictures were taken with the narrow-angle camera (1500 mm focal length) and were not pointed directly at the sun, they show the effects of the glare from the nearby sun, in the form of long linear streaks resulting from the scattering of sunlight off parts of the camera and its sun shade. From Voyager's great distance both Earth and Venus are mere points of light, less than the size of a picture element even in the narrow-angle camera. Earth was a crescent only 0.12 pixel in size. Coincidentally, Earth lies right in the center of one of the scattered light rays resulting from taking the image so close to the sun. Detailed analysis also suggests that Voyager detected the moon as well, but it is too faint to be seen without special processing. Venus was only 0.11 pixel in diameter. The faint colored structure in both planetary frames results from sunlight scattered in the optics."
Solar System Portrait - Earth as ‘Pale Blue Dot’,1996-09-12,PIA00452,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00452,"This narrow-angle color image of the Earth, dubbed 'Pale Blue Dot', is a part of the first ever 'portrait' of the solar system taken by Voyager 1. The spacecraft acquired a total of 60 frames for a mosaic of the solar system from a distance of more than 4 billion miles from Earth and about 32 degrees above the ecliptic. From Voyager's great distance Earth is a mere point of light, less than the size of a picture element even in the narrow-angle camera. Earth was a crescent only 0.12 pixel in size. Coincidentally, Earth lies right in the center of one of the scattered light rays resulting from taking the image so close to the sun. This blown-up image of the Earth was taken through three color filters -- violet, blue and green -- and recombined to produce the color image. The background features in the image are artifacts resulting from the magnification."
Jupiter with Io Crossing,1979-01-17,PIA00455,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00455,"Jupiter's satellite Io poses before the giant planet in this photo returned January 17, 1979, from a distance of 29 million miles (47 million kilometers). The satellite's shadow can be seen falling on the face of Jupiter at left. Io is traveling from left to right in its one-and-three-quarter-day orbit around Jupiter. Even from this great distance the image of Io shows dark poles and a bright equatorial region. Voyager will make its closest approach to Jupiter -- 174,000 miles (280,000 kilometer) -- on March 5. It will then continue to Saturn in November 1980, Meanwhile Voyager 2, a sister spacecraft, will fly past Jupiter July 9, 1979, and reach Saturn in August 1981. This color image was taken through orange, green and blue filters."
Solar System Portrait - 60 Frame Mosaic,1990-02-14,PIA00451,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00451,"The cameras of Voyager 1 on Feb. 14, 1990, pointed back toward the sun and took a series of pictures of the sun and the planets, making the first ever ""portrait"" of our solar system as seen from the outside. In the course of taking this mosaic consisting of a total of 60 frames, Voyager 1 made several images of the inner solar system from a distance of approximately 4 billion miles and about 32 degrees above the ecliptic plane. Thirty-nine wide angle frames link together six of the planets of our solar system in this mosaic. Outermost Neptune is 30 times further from the sun than Earth. Our sun is seen as the bright object in the center of the circle of frames. The wide-angle image of the sun was taken with the camera's darkest filter (a methane absorption band) and the shortest possible exposure (5 thousandths of a second) to avoid saturating the camera's vidicon tube with scattered sunlight. The sun is not large as seen from Voyager, only about one-fortieth of the diameter as seen from Earth, but is still almost 8 million times brighter than the brightest star in Earth's sky, Sirius. The result of this great brightness is an image with multiple reflections from the optics in the camera. Wide-angle images surrounding the sun also show many artifacts attributable to scattered light in the optics. These were taken through the clear filter with one second exposures. The insets show the planets magnified many times. Narrow-angle images of Earth, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune were acquired as the spacecraft built the wide-angle mosaic. Jupiter is larger than a narrow-angle pixel and is clearly resolved, as is Saturn with its rings. Uranus and Neptune appear larger than they really are because of image smear due to spacecraft motion during the long (15 second) exposures. From Voyager's great distance Earth and Venus are mere points of light, less than the size of a picture element even in the narrow-angle camera. Earth was a crescent only 0.12 pixel in size. Coincidentally, Earth lies right in the center of one of the scattered light rays resulting from taking the image so close to the sun."
First Close-up Image of Jupiter from Voyager 1,1996-09-26,PIA00029,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00029,"NASA'S Voyager 1 took this picture of the planet Jupiter on Saturday, Jan. 6, the first in its three-month-long, close-up investigation of the largest planet. The spacecraft, flying toward a March 5 closest approach, was 35.8 million miles (57.6 million kilometers) from Jupiter and 371.7 million miles (598.2 million kilometers) from Earth when the picture was taken. As the Voyager cameras begin their meteorological surveillance of Jupiter, they reveal a dynamic atmosphere with more convective structure than had previously been thought. While the smallest atmospheric features seen in this picture are still as large as 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) across, Voyager will be able to detect individual storm systems as small as 3 miles (5 kilometers) at closest approach. The Great Red Spot can be seen near the limb at the far right. Most of the other features are too small to be seen in terrestrial telescopes. This picture is really a combination of three images taken through color filters, then transmitted to Jet Propulsion Laboratory through the Deep Space Network's antennas, and assembled by JPL's Image Processing Lab."
Solar System Portrait - Views of 6 Planets,1996-09-13,PIA00453,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00453,"These six narrow-angle color images were made from the first ever 'portrait' of the solar system taken by Voyager 1, which was more than 4 billion miles from Earth and about 32 degrees above the ecliptic. The spacecraft acquired a total of 60 frames for a mosaic of the solar system which shows six of the planets. Mercury is too close to the sun to be seen. Mars was not detectable by the Voyager cameras due to scattered sunlight in the optics, and Pluto was not included in the mosaic because of its small size and distance from the sun. These blown-up images, left to right and top to bottom are Venus, Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. The background features in the images are artifacts resulting from the magnification. The images were taken through three color filters -- violet, blue and green -- and recombined to produce the color images. Jupiter and Saturn were resolved by the camera but Uranus and Neptune appear larger than they really are because of image smear due to spacecraft motion during the long (15 second) exposure times. Earth appears to be in a band of light because it coincidentally lies right in the center of the scattered light rays resulting from taking the image so close to the sun. Earth was a crescent only 0.12 pixels in size. Venus was 0.11 pixel in diameter. The planetary images were taken with the narrow-angle camera (1500 mm focal length)."
Io - Volcanic Eruption,1979-03-04,PIA00373,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00373,"This photo of a volcanic eruption on Jupiter's satellite Io (dark fountain-like feature near the limb) was taken March 4, 1979, about 12 hours before Voyager 1's closest approach to Jupiter. This and the accompanying photo present the evidence for the first active volcanic eruption ever observed on another body in the solar system. This photo taken from a distance of 310,000 miles (499,000 kilometers), shows a plume-like structure rising more than 60 miles (100 kilometers) above the surface, a cloud of material being produced by an active eruption. At least four eruptions have been identified on Voyager 1 pictures and many more may yet be discovered on closer analysis. On a nearly airless body like Io, particulate material thrown out of a volcano follows a ballistic trajectory, accounting for the dome-like shape of the top of the cloud, formed as particles reach the top of their flight path and begin to fall back. Spherical expansion of outflowing gas forms an even larger cloud surrounding the dust. Several regions have been identified by the infrared instrument on Voyager 1 as being several hundred degrees Fahrenheit warmer than surrounding terrain, and correlated with the eruptions. The fact that several eruptions appear to be going on simultaneously makes Io the most active surface in the solar system and suggests to scientists that Io is undergoing continuous volcanism, revising downward the age of Io's surface once again."
Io - One of at Least Four Simultaneous Erupting Volcanic Eruptions,1979-03-04,PIA00374,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00374,"This photo of an active volcanic eruption on Jupiter's satellite Io was taken 1 hour, 52 minutes after the accompanying picture, late in the evening of March 4, 1979, Pacific time. On the limb of the satellite can be seen one of at least four simultaneous volcanic eruptions -- the first such activity ever observed on another celestial body. Seen against the limb are plume-like structures rising more than 60 miles (100 kilometers) above the surface. Several eruptions have been identified with volcanic structures on the surface of Io, which have also been identified by Voyager 1's infrared instrument as being abnormally hot -- several hundred degrees warmer than surrounding terrain. The fact that several eruptions appear to be occurring at the same time suggests that Io has the most active surface in the solar system and that volcanism is going on there essentially continuously. Another characteristic of the observed volcanism is that it appears to be extremely explosive, with velocities more than 2,000 miles an hour (at least 1 kilometer per second). That is more violent than terrestrial volcanoes like Etna, Vesuvius or Krakatoa."
Io - Volcano Loki and Loki Patera,1996-11-16,PIA00375,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00375,"The detailed structure near the volcano Loki is like nothing seen elsewhere on Io. When this Voyager 1 picture was taken, the main eruptive activity came from the lower left of the dark linear feature (perhaps a rift) in the center. Below is the ""lava lake,"" a U-shaped dark area about 200 kilometers across. In this specially processed image, detail can be seen in the dark surface of this feature, possibly due to ""icebergs"" of solid sulfur in a liquid sulfur lake. The IRIS on Voyager 1 found this ""lava lake"" to be the hottest region on Io, with a temperature about 150 degrees Celsius higher than that of the surrounding area."
Io At 5 Million Miles,1979-03-02,PIA00378,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00378,"This photo of Jupiter's satellite Io was taken by Voyager 1 about 4:30 p.m. (PST) March 2, 1979. The spacecraft was about 5 million miles (8.3 million kilometers away). Voyager 1 was mapping Jupiter with the cameras and infrared instrument at the time the picture was taken. The hemisphere seen here is the one that always faces away from Jupiter. This photo shows details on Io never before seen. The smallest features are about 38 miles (70 kilometers) across. Near the center and slightly to the right can be seen several round features with dark centers and bright rims. They may be the first craters ever observed on Io. At this resolution scientists still cannot tell much about the origin of the features, which could be impact craters or of internal (volcanic) origin. No ray or ejecta patterns are obvious at this resolution."
Concentric Rings Surrounding Valhalla,1997-01-09,PIA00484,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00484,"The concentric rings surrounding Valhalla are perhaps the most distinctive geological feature on Callisto. This Voyager 1 close-up shows a segment of the ridged terrain. The presence of superimpact craters shows that the rings formed early in Callisto's history; however, the density of craters is less here than on other parts of the satellite, where the surface is older."
Volcanic Eruptions on Io,1979-03-08,PIA00379,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00379,"This dramatic view of Jupiter's satellite Io shows two simultaneously occurring volcanic eruptions. One can be seen on the limb, (at lower right) in which ash clouds are rising more than 150 miles (260 kilometers) above the satellite's surface. The second can be seen on the terminator (shadow between day and night) where the volcanic cloud is catching the rays of the rising sun. The dark hemisphere of Io is made visible by light reflected from Jupiter. Seen in Io's night sky, Jupiter looms almost 40 times larger and 200 times brighter than our own full Moon. This photo was taken by Voyager 1 on March 8, 1979, looking back 2.6 million miles (4.5 million kilometers) at Io, three days after its historic encounter. This is the same image in which Linda A. Morabito, a JPL engineer, discovered the first extraterrestrial volcanic eruption (the bright curved volcanic cloud on the limb)."
"Ganymede At 150,000 Miles",1979-03-05,PIA00380,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00380,"This picture of Ganymede, Jupiter's largest satellite, was taken by Voyager 1 on the afternoon of March 5, 1979, from a range of about 250,000 km (150,000 mi.). The center of the picture is at 60 north latitude and 318 longitude, and the distance across the bottom of the photograph is about 1000 km (600 mi.). The smallest features visible in this picture are about 5 km (3 mi.) across. This picture shows impact craters many of which display ray systems probably consisting largely of icy material thrown out by the impacts. Peculiar systems of sinuous ridges and grooves traverse the surface and are best seen near the terminator. These ridges and grooves are probably the result of deformation of the thick ice crust on Ganymede."
Lights In The Night,1979-03-05,PIA00204,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00204,"LIGHTS IN THE NIGHT ON JUPITER: This Voyager 1 image was taken of Jupiter's darkside on March 5, 1979. The picture is a 3 minute, 12 second exposure by the wide angle camera taken when the spacecraft was in Jupiter's shadow, about 6 hours after closest approach to the planet at a distance of 320,000 miles. Jupiter's north pole is on the limb toward the upper center. The long bright double streak is an aurora on Jupiter's limb near its north pole. The other bright spots probably are lightning but could be auroral features. The aurora s structure may be real or it may be caused by scan platform stepping during the exposure. The diagonal displacement of bright spots within each of the three active regions is due generally to the scan platform stepping; but the patterns do not reproduce in detail nor do they exhibit exactly the displacements of the camera during the exposure. As lightning flashes they are comparable to the brightness of superbolts seen at the tops of terrestrial tropical thunderstorms. As auroral features they would be required to be much brighter than those on Earth."
Titan’s Brighter Southern Hemisphere,1980-11-04,PIA00733,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00733,"Titan, the largest of Saturn's 14 known satellites, shows little more than the upper layers of clouds covering the moon in this Voyager 1 picture, taken on November 4, 1980 at a range of 12 million kilometers (7,560,000 miles). The orange colored haze, believed to be composed of photochemically produced hydrocarbons, hides Titan's solid surface from the Voyager cameras. Some weak shadings in the clouds are becoming visible. However, note that the satellite's southern (lower) hemisphere is brighter than the northern. It is not known whether these subtle shadings are on the surface or are due to clouds below a high haze layer."
"Io, the South Polar Region",1998-06-04,PIA00327,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00327,"This Voyager 1 image mosaic shows Io's south polar region. The South Pole is near the terminator (line between daylight and night) at right center. Haemus Mons, a 10-km high (32,000 foot) mountain is at bottom. Elsewhere, much flatter volcanic plains, eroded volcanic plateaus, and crater-like volcanic calderas dominate the scene. The partly black-filled caldera at far left is Creidne Patera. The composition of the prevalent volcanic plains of Io could consist dominantly of sulfur with a thin discontinuous coating of sulfur dioxide frost or of silicates (such as basalt) coated with sulfurous condensates. The black material in Creidne Patera is where sulfur or silicates are probably still molten, whereas the brown material in the caldera is probably where the sulfur has solidified."
Volcanic Plains of Io Near Galai Patera,1998-06-04,PIA00324,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00324,"Io's volcanic plains are shown in this Voyager 1 image, which spans an area about 1030 km (640 miles) from left to right. North is about the 1:30 position. Numerous volcanic calderas and lava flows are visible here. The brown teardrop-shaped feature at left center is Galai Patera, a 100-km-long (62 mi) lava-flooded caldera (collapsed vent) of a volcano. The composition of Io's volcanic plains and lava flows has not been determined. The prevalent yellow, brown, and orange material may consist dominantly of sulfur with surface frosts of sulfur dioxide or of silicates (such as basalt) encrusted with sulfur and sulfur dioxide condensates. The whitish patches probably are freshly deposited SO2 frost."

"Io, the Ra Patera, Mazda Catena, and Gibil Patera Area",1998-06-04,PIA00321,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00321,"Io's volcanic plains are shown in this Voyager 1 image mosaic. Also visible are numerous volcanic calderas and lava flows. Ra Patera with its multihued lava flows is below and right of the mosaic's center. This scene is about 1300 miles (2100 km) long. The composition of Io's volcanic plains and lava flows has not been determined, but they could consist dominantly of sulfur or of silicates (such as basalt) coated with sulfur condensates. The bright whitish patches probably consist of freshly deposited SO2 frost."
Loki Patera,1998-06-04,PIA00320,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00320,"A huge area of Io's volcanic plains is shown in this Voyager 1 image mosaic. Numerous volcanic calderas and lava flows are visible here. Loki Patera, an active lava lake, is the large shield-shaped black feature. Heat emitted from Loki can be seen through telescopes all the way from Earth. These telescopic observations tell us that Loki has been active continuously (or at least every time astronomers have looked) since the Voyager 1 flyby in March 1979. The composition of Io's volcanic plains and lava flows has not been determined, but they could consist dominantly of sulfur with surface frosts of sulfur dioxide or of silicates (such as basalts) encrusted with sulfur and sulfur dioxide condensates. The bright whitish patches probably consist of freshly deposited SO2 frost. The black spots, including Loki, are probably hot sulfur lava, which may remain molten by intrusions of molten silicate magma, coming up from deeper within Io. The ultimate source of heat that keeps Io active is tidal frictional heating due to the continual flexure of Io by the gravity of Jupiter and Europa, another of Jupiter's satellites."
Io Shown in Lambertian Equal Area Projection and in Approximately Natural Color,1998-06-04,PIA00318,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00318,"Voyager 1 computer color mosaics, shown in approximately natural color and in Lambertian equal-area projections, show the Eastern (left) and Western (right) hemispheres of Io. This innermost of Jupiter's 4 major satellites is the most volcanically active object in the solar system. Io is 2263 mi (3640 km) in diameter, making it a little bigger than Earth's moon. Almost all the features visible here have volcanic origins, including several calderas and eruption plumes that were active at the time of the Voyager 1 encounter."
Global Mercator Mosaic,1998-06-04,PIA00319,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00319,"Io's volcanic plains are shown in this Voyager 1 image mosaic which covers the area roughly from latitude 60 degrees N. to latitude 60 degrees S. and longitude 100-345. North is up. Numerous volcanic calderas, lava flows, and volcanic eruption plumes are visible here. The composition of Io's volcanic plains and lava flows has not been determined, but they could consist dominantly of sulfur with surface frosts of sulfur dioxide or of silicates (such as basalt) encrusted with sulfur and sulfur dioxide condensates.

"Io, Showing Volcanic Plains and Mountains",1998-06-04,PIA00328,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00328,"Io's volcanic plains are shown in this Voyager 1 image. Also visible are numerous volcanic calderas and two large mountains (Euboea Montes, just above center, and Haemus Montes, at lower left). The plains include some distinct lava flows, such as those of Lerna Regio (lower right), and low mesas, such as Nemeas Planum (bottom center) and Dodona Planum (just left of center). This scene is about 1050 mi (1700 km) from left to right. The composition of Io's volcanic plains and lava flows has not been determined, but they could consist dominantly of sulfur or of silicates (such as basalt) coated with sulfurous condensates. The apparent erosion of the edges of some mesas suggests that they are composed of something volatile, possibly including a component of SO2 ice, which is observed spectroscopically to be widespread on Io. The high topographic relief in some areas, particularly of the montes, suggests that those areas are made primarily of silicate rock, which is much stronger than sulfur or SO2. The bright aureoles around several features probably consist of freshly deposited SO2 frost that was vented from cracks and volcanic conduits."

First Evidence of Jupiter Ring,1979-03-04,PIA01484,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01484,"First evidence of a ring around the planet Jupiter is seen in this photograph taken by Voyager 1 on March 4, 1979. The multiple exposure of the extremely thin faint ring appears as a broad light band crossing the center of the picture. The edge of the ring is 1,212,000 km from the spacecraft and 57,000 km from the visible cloud deck of Jupiter. The background stars look like broken hair pins because of spacecraft motion during the 11 minute 12 second exposure. The wavy motion of the star trails is due to the ultra-slow natural oscillation of the spacecraft (with a period of 78 seconds). The black dots are geometric calibration points in the camera. The ring thickness is estimated to be 30 km or less. The photograph was part of a sequence planned to search for such rings in Jupiter's equatorial plane. The ring has been invisible from Earth because of its thinness and its transparency when viewed at any angle except straight on."

Saturn’s Satellite Dione,1980-11-09,PIA01373,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01373,"This picture of Saturn's satellite Dione was taken by NASA's Voyager 1 on Nov. 9, 1980 from a distance of 4.2 million kilometers (2.6 million miles). Light and dark patches are visible on the moon's surface, reminiscent of features seen on Jupiter's satellite Ganymede during Voyagers's Jupiter encounter last year. The bright spots may be rays emanating from impact craters on Dione's surface. Dione is about 1,110 kilometers in diameter, about one-third the size of Earth's Moon. The smallest detail seen in this image is about 78 kilometers (48 miles) across."
Saturn’s Satellite Rhea,1980-11-11,PIA01372,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01372,"Bright streaks and blotches are visible against a darker back-ground on the surface of Saturn's satellite Rhea, seen in this Voyager 1 image taken Nov. 11, 1980 from a range of 1,925,000 kilometers (1,196,000 miles). Even the dark areas, thought to be water frost and ice, are fairly bright with about 50 percent reflectance. The bright streaks may be related to impacts by objects that throw out pulverized ice grains from beneath the ice-covered surface. Some of the bright streaks are not straight but have a curved appearance similar to the grooved, icy terrain on Jupiter's satellite Ganymede seen in Voyager photographs taken at this resolution. Scientists do knot yet know if a satellite of Rhea's size (approximately 1,500 kilometers or 900 miles in diameter) can have an active thermal history like Ganymede's, but higher resolution photographs taken by Voyager should reveal clues to its history."
Voyager Picture of Jupiter,1979-01-06,PIA01371,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01371,"NASA's Voyager 1 took this picture of the planet Jupiter on Saturday, Jan. 6, 1979, the first in its three-month-long, close-up investigation of the largest planet. The spacecraft, flying toward a March 5 closest approach, was 35.8 million miles (57.6 million kilometers) from Jupiter and 371.7 million miles (598.2 million kilometers) from Earth when the picture was taken. As the Voyager cameras begin their meteorological surveillance of Jupiter, they reveal a dynamic atmosphere with more convective structure than had previously been thought. While the smallest atmospheric features seen in this picture are still as large as 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) across, Voyager will be able to detect individual storm systems as small as 3 miles (5 kilometers) at closest approach. The Great Red Spot can be seen near the limb at the far right. Most of the other features are too small to be seen in terrestrial telescopes."

Also visible are irregular valleys that represent old fault troughs degraded by impacts. The center of the frame is at 26 degrees south latitude on the Saturn-facing hemisphere."
Saturn’s Ring System,1980-11-09,PIA01374,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01374,"Both the limb of Saturn and the shadow of its ring system are seen through the transparent C-ring in this striking picture taken by NASA's Voyager 1 on Nov. 9, 1980 at a distance of 4.5 million kilometers (3 million miles). Gaps and regions of high transparency are seen throughout the C-ring, especially in the area closest to the opaque B-ring. Shadows of the A-, B-, and C-rings are clearly visible on the disk of Saturn. The C-ring shadow showing the gaps described above is the uppermost shadow; below this is the very black shadow of the opaque B-ring, then the Cassini Division, and at the bottom, the shadow of the A-ring."
Saturn’s North Temperate Region,1980-11-05,PIA01375,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01375,"This comparison shows Saturn's north temperate region as viewed Nov. 5, 1980, by Voyager 1 (left) and Aug. 21 by its sister craft, Voyager 2, from a range of 5 million kilometers (3.1 million miles). The large bright oval feature in the lower right of each frame measures about 2,500 km. (1,550 mi.) across. This feature, a gigantic storm system in the planet's atmosphere, was first observed by Voyager 1 almost exactly one year ago. Thus, as on Jupiter, some storms in Saturn's atmosphere are quite long-lived compared to their smaller terrestrial counterparts. By contrast, the pattern of convective disturbances to the north (upper right) undergoes rapid changes in a matter of even a few days. In some respects, these features resemble gigantic thunderstorms. The largest bright feature in the Voyager 1 photograph extends about 7,500 km. (4,650 mi.) from north to south. These giant storms lie within one of the strongest westward-flowing currents observed in the atmosphere, with wind speeds of about 20 meters-per-second (45 mph). The smallest visible features here are about 100 km. (62 mi.) across."

The soft, velvety appearance of the low-contrast banded structure and increased reflection of blue light near the perimeter of the Saturn disk are due to scattering by a haze layer above the planet's cloud deck. Features larger than 350 kilometers (220 miles) are visible. The projected width of the rings at the center of the disk is 10,000 kilometers (6,000 miles), which provides a scale for estimating feature sizes on the image."

The picture was taken March 4 about 5:00 p.m. from a range of about half a million kilometers showing an eruption region on the horizon. This method of color analysis allows scientists to combine data from four pictures, taken in ultraviolet, blue, green and orange light. In this picture one can see the strong change in color of the erupting plume. The region that is brighter in ultraviolet light (blue in this image) is much more extensive than the denser, bright yellow region near the center of the eruption. Scientists will use data of this type to study the amount of gas and dust in the eruption and the size of dust particles. Preliminary analysis suggests that the bright ultraviolet part of the cloud may be due to scattered light from very fine particles (the same effect which makes smoke appear bluish)."

This picture is south of PIA01516(P21262) near the equator of Ganymede, and has relatively subdued colors in the visible part of the spectrum (later, scientists will analyze Voyager pictures taken in UV). The most striking features are the bright ray craters which have a distinctly ""bluer"" color appearing white against the redder background. Ganymede's surface is known to contain large amounts of surface ice and it appears that these relatively young craters have spread bright fresh ice materials over the surface. Likewise, the lighter color and reflectivity of the grooved areas suggest that here, too, there is cleaner ice. We see ray craters with all sizes of ray patterns, ranging from extensive systems, down to craters which have only faint remnants of bright ejecta patterns.

Io Surface Deposits and Volcanic Craters,1979-03-05,PIA01514,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01514,"This picture of Io, the innermost Galilean satellite, was taken by Voyager 1 on the morning of March 5, 1979 at a range of 377,000 kilometers (226,200 miles). The smallest features visible are about 10 kilometers (6 miles) across. The reddish, white and black areas are probably surface deposits, possibly consisting of mixtures of salts, sulfur and sublimate deposits of possible volcanic origin. Many of the black spots in these pictures are associated with craters of possible volcanic origin. The lack of impact craters on Io suggests that the surface is relatively young compared to the other Galilean satellites and some of the terrestrial planets such as Mercury and the Moon."

The smallest details that can be seen in this photo are about 45 miles (80 kilometers) across."
Jupiter’s Great Red Spot and White Ovals,1979-03-01,PIA01512,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01512,"This photo of Jupiter was taken by Voyager 1 on the evening of March 1, 1979, from a distance of 2.7 million miles (4.3 million kilometers). The photo shows Jupiter's Great Red Spot (top) and one of the white ovals than can be seen in Jupiter's atmosphere from Earth. The white ovals were seen to form in 1939, and 1940, and have remained more or less constant ever since. None of the structure and detail evident in these features have ever been seen from Earth. The Great Red Spot is three times as large as Earth. Also evident in the picture is a great deal of atmospheric detail that will require further study for interpretation. The smallest details that can be seen in this picture are about 45 miles (80 kilometers~ across."
"Callisto From 7,000,000 kilometers",1999-03-15,PIA01511,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01511,"This Voyager 1 picture of Callisto, the outermost Galilean satellite, was taken February 28 from a distance of about 5 million miles (7 million kilometers). Callisto is the darkest of the Galilean satellites but is still nearly twice as bright as the Earth's Moon. The surface shows a mottled appearance consisting of bright and dark patches. The bright spots remind scientists of rayed or bright haloed craters, similar to those seen on the Earth's Moon. The Galilean satellites all show the same face to Jupiter -- just as the Earth's Moon always shows us the same face. In this photo we see the face of Callisto that always faces Jupiter."
"Callisto From 8,023,000 kilometers",1999-03-15,PIA01510,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01510,"This photo of Callisto, outermost of Jupiter's four Galilean satellites, was taken a few minutes after midnight (PST) Feb. 26 by Voyager 1. The distance to Callisto was 8,023,000 kilometers (4.98 million miles). The hemisphere in this picture shows a fairly uniform surface dotted with brighter spots that are up to several hundred kilometers across. Scientists believe the spots may be impact craters but higher-resolution photos will be necessary before the features can be interpreted. Callisto is about the same size as the planet Mercury -- about 5,000 kilometers (3,000 miles) in diameter. Callisto is much less massive than Mercury, however, giving density less than twice that of water. Scientists believe Callisto, therefore, is composed of a mixture of rock and ice (up to about 50 percent by weight). Its surface is darker than those of the other Galilean satellites, but is still about twice as bright as Earth's Moon. This color photo was assembled from three black and white images in the Image Processing Lab at Jet Propulsion Laboratory."
Jupiter and Three Galilean Satellites,1979-02-05,PIA00358,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00358,"Jupiter, its Great Red Spot and three of its four largest satellites are visible in this photo taken Feb. 5, 1979, by Voyager 1. The spacecraft was 28.4 million kilometers (17.5 million miles) from the planet at the time. The innermost large satellite, Io, can be seen against Jupiter's disk. Io is distinguished by its bright, brown-yellow surface. To the right of Jupiter is the satellite Europa, also very bright but with fainter surface markings. The darkest satellite, Callisto (still nearly twice as bright as Earth's Moon), is barely visible at the bottom left of the picture. Callisto shows a bright patch in its northern hemisphere. All three orbit Jupiter in the equatorial plane, and appear in their present position because Voyager is above the plane. All three satellites show the same face to Jupiter always -- just as Earth's Moon always shows us the same face. In this photo we see the sides of the satellites that always face away from the planet. Jupiter's colorfully banded atmosphere displays complex patterns highlighted by the Great Red Spot, a large, circulating atmospheric disturbance. This photo was assembled from three black and white negatives by the Image Processing Lab at Jet Propulsion Laboratory."
Jupiter Great Red Spot and White Ovals,1979-03-01,PIA00359,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00359,"This photo of Jupiter was taken by Voyager 1 on March 1, 1979. The spacecraft was 3 million miles (5 million kilometers) from Jupiter at the time. The photo shows Jupiter's Great Red Spot (upper right) and the turbulent region immediately to the west. At the middle right of the frame is one of several white ovals seen on Jupiter from Earth. The structure in every feature here is far better than has ever been seen from any telescopic observations. The Red Spot and the white oval both reveal intricate and involved structure. The smallest details that can be seen in this photo are about 55 miles (95 kilometers) across."
Ganymede Full Disk,1979-03-04,PIA00353,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00353,"This picture was taken on March 4, 1979 at 2:30 A.M. PST by Voyager 1 from a distance of 2.6 million kilometers (1.6 million miles). Ganymede is Jupiter's largest satellite with a radius of about 2600 kilometers, about 1.5 times that of our Moon. Ganymede has a bulk density of only approximately 2.0 g/cc almost half that of the Moon. Therefore, Ganymede is probably composed of a mixture of rock and ice. The features here, the large dark regions, in the northeast quadrant, and the white spots, resemble features found on the Moon, mare and impact craters respectively. The long white filaments resemble rays associated with impacts on the lunar surface. The various colors of different regions probably represent differing surface materials. There are several dots on the picture of single color (blue, green, and orange) which are the result of markings on the camera used for pointing determinations and are not physical markings."
Jupiter Full Disk with Great Red Spot,1979-01-09,PIA01509,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01509,"This recent photo of Jupiter taken by the television cameras aboard NASA's Voyager 1 is dominated by the Great Red Spot. Although the spacecraft is still 34 million miles (54 million kilometers) from a March 5 closest approach, Voyager's cameras already reveal details within the spot that aren't visible from Earth. An atmospheric system larger than Earth and more than 300 years old, the Great Red Spot remains a mystery and a challenge to Voyager's instruments. Swirling, storm-like features possibly associated with wind shear can be seen both to the left and above the Red Spot. Analysis of motions of the features will lead to a better understanding of weather in Jupiter's atmosphere. This photo was taken Jan. 9, 1979 and reassembled at Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Image Processing Laboratory."
Callisto’s Icy Surface,1999-03-06,PIA00362,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00362,"This color photo of Jupiter's satellite Callisto was made from three black-and-white images taken March 5 from a distance of 746,000 miles (1.2 million kilometers). It shows the entire hemisphere of Callisto that was photographed at high resolution by Voyager 1 during the close encounter with the satellite on March 6. Visible near the upper left limb is the large basin-like structure discovered by Voyager 1. The central region of the basin is much brighter than the average surface of the satellite. Near the south polar region are two bright areas associated with smaller basin-like structures. These bright areas are believed to contain more clean ice than the rest of Callisto's generally 'dirty-ice' surface."
High Winds in the Jovian Mid-latitudes,1979-03-02,PIA00360,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00360,"A high resolution image of the Jovian mid-latitudes taken by Voyager 1 on March 2, 1979, shows distinctly differing characteristics of the planet's meteorology. The well defined pale orange line running from southwest to northeast (North is at the top) marks the high speed north temperate current with wind speeds of about 120 meters per second. These high winds produce a cleaner flow pattern in the surrounding clouds. Toward the top of the picture, a weaker jet of approximately 30 meters per second is characterized by wave patterns and cloud features which have been observed to rotate in a clockwise manner at these latitudes of about 35 North. These clouds have been observed to have lifetimes of about one to two years. The picture was taken from a distance of 4 million kilometers (2.5 million miles)."
Crescent-shaped Earth and Moon,1977-08-20,PIA01967,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01967,"This picture of a crescent-shaped Earth and Moon -- the first of its kind ever taken by a spacecraft -- was recorded Sept. 18, 1977, by NASA's Voyager 1 when it was 7.25 million miles (11.66 million kilometers) from Earth. The Moon is at the top of the picture and beyond the Earth as viewed by Voyager. In the picture are eastern Asia, the western Pacific Ocean and part of the Arctic. Voyager 1 was directly above Mt. Everest (on the night side of the planet at 25 degrees north latitude) when the picture was taken. The photo was made from three images taken through color filters, then processed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Image Processing Lab. Because the Earth is many times brighter than the Moon, the Moon was artificially brightened by a factor of three relative to the Earth by computer enhancement so that both bodies would show clearly in the print. Voyager 2 was launched Aug. 20, 1977, followed by Voyager 1 on Sept. 5, 1977, en route to encounters at Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980 and 1981. JPL manages the Voyager mission for NASA."
Saturn’s Moon Mimas,1980-11-12,PIA01968,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01968,"The cratered surface Saturn's moon Mimas is seen in this image taken by Voyager 1 on Nov. 12, 1980 from a range of 425,000 kilometers (264,000 miles). Impact craters made by the infall of cosmic debris are shown; the largest is more than 100 kilometers (62 miles) in diameter and displays a prominent central peak. The smaller craters are abundant and indicate an ancient age for Mima's surface."
Saturn and its Rings,1980-11-16,PIA01969,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01969,"Voyager 1 looked back at Saturn on Nov. 16, 1980, four days after the spacecraft flew past the planet, to observe the appearance of Saturn and its rings from this unique perspective. A few of the spokelike ring features discovered by Voyager appear in the rings as bright patches in this image, taken at a distance of 5.3 million kilometers (3.3 million miles) from the planet. Saturn's shadow falls upon the rings, and the bright Saturn crescent is seen through all but the densest portion of the rings. From Saturn, Voyager 1 is on a trajectory taking the spacecraft out of the ecliptic plane, away from the Sun and eventually out of the solar system (by about 1990). Although its mission to Jupiter and Saturn is nearly over (the Saturn encounter ends Dec. 18, 1980), Voyager 1 will be tracked by the Deep Space Network as far as possible in an effort to determine where the influence of the Sun ends and interstellar space begins. Voyager 1's flight path through interstellar space is in the direction of the constellation Ophiuchus. Voyager 2 will reach Saturn on August 25, 1981, and is targeted to encounter Uranus in 1986 and possibly Neptune in 1989."
Titan Haze,1980-11-12,PIA01533,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01533,"Layers of haze covering Saturn's satellite Titan are seen in this image taken by Voyager 1 on Nov. 12, 1980 at a range of 22,000 kilometers (13,700 miles). The colors are false and are used to show details of the haze that covers Titan. The upper level of the thick aerosol above the satellite's limb appears orange. The divisions in the haze occur at altitudes of 200, 375 and 500 kilometers (124, 233 and 310 miles) above the limb of the moon."
Volcanic Activity on Io,1999-05-08,PIA01530,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01530,"Io's volcanos continually resurface it, so that any impact craters have disappeared."
Full-disk Color Image of Crescent Saturn with Rings and Ring Shadows,1980-11-16,PIA00335,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00335,"Voyager 1 image of Saturn and its ring taken Nov. 16, 1980 four days after closest approach to Saturn, from a distance of 5,300, 000 km (3,300,000 miles). This viewing geometry, which shows Saturn as a crescent, is never achieved from Earth. The Saturnian rings, like the cloud tops of Saturn itself, are visible because they reflect sunlight. The translucent nature of the rings is apparent where Saturn can be seen through parts of the rings. Other parts of the rings are so dense with orbiting ice particles that almost no sunlight shines through them and a shadow is cast onto the yellowish cloud tops of Saturn, which in turn, casts a shadow across the rings at right. The black strip within the rings is the Cassini Division, which contains much less orbiting ring material than elsewhere in the rings."
Volcanic Explosion on Io,1999-06-16,PIA01971,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01971,"VOLCANIC EXPLOSION ON IO: Voyager 1 acquired this image of Io on March 4 at 5:30 p.m. (PST) about 11 hours before closest approach to the Jupiter moon. The distance to Io was about 490,000 kilometers (304,000 miles). An enormous volcanic explosion can be seen silhouetted against dark space over Io's bright limb. The brightness of the plume has been increased by the computer as it is normally extremely faint, whereas the relative color of the plume (greenish white) has been preserved. At this time solid material had been thrown up to an altitude of about 100 miles. This requires an ejection velocity from the volcanic vent of about 1200 miles per hour, material reaching the crest of the fountain in several minutes. The vent area is a complex circular structure consisting of a bright ring about 300 kilometers in diameter and a central region of irregular dark and light patterns. Volcanic explosions similar to this occur on the Earth when magmatic gases expand explosively as material is vented. On Earth water is the major gas driving the explosion. Because Io is thought to be extremely dry, scientists are searching for other gases to explain the explosion."
"Europa from 2,869,252 Kilometers",1999-06-16,PIA01970,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01970,"View of Europa taken from a range of 2,869,252 kilometers (1.6 million miles) on March 2 at 2:00 PM. The color composite is made from three black and white images taken through the orange, green and violet filters. The 170 longitude is at the center of the picture; this is the face away from Jupiter. Irregular dark and bright patches on the surface are different from the patterns on the other satellites of Jupiter and those on the Moon, Mars and Mercury. Dark intersecting lines may be faults that break the crust."
Cratered Surface of Tethys,1999-06-16,PIA01974,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01974,"The heavily cratered surface of Tethys was photographed at l:35 a.m. PST on November 12 from a distance of l.2 million kilometers (750,000 miles) by Voyager l. This face of Tethys looks toward Saturn and shows a large valley about 750 kilometers long and 60 kilometers wide (500 by 40 miles). The craters are probably the result of impacts and the valley appears to be a large fracture of unknown origin. The diameter of Tethys is about 1000 kilometers (600 miles) or slightly less than l/3 the size of our Moon. The smallest feature visible on this picture is about 24 kilometers across."
Io - Jupiter’s inner satellite,1979-03-03,PIA01986,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01986,"The trailing face of Jupiter's inner satellite Io is shown in this photo taken by Voyager 1 on March 3, 1979, from a distance of 1.7 million miles. A bright yellow-orange equatorial band (lower left to upper right) separates the darker reddish-brown polar zones. The north pole is at upper left. Characteristic of Io's surface is the profusion of dark spots commonly surrounded by rings of brighter material. The smallest dark spot visible in this view is 30 kilometers wide; the largest, on the left is about 400 kilometers across. The large heart-shaped feature with a dark spot near its center could be Io's equivalent of an impact basin such as Mare Orientale on the Moon. Its outer dimensions are about 800 by 1000 km. It is located near (15 S by 260 W). Subsequent high-resolution coverage should reveal whether the small dark spots are impact craters, or perhaps something more exotic such as volcanoes. The reddish color of Io has been attributed to sulfur in the salts which are believed by some to make up the surface of Io. Water frost, which occurs on the surfaces of the other Galilean satellites, is absent on Io."
Ganymede,1999-07-23,PIA01987,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01987,"Voyager 1 took this picture of Jupiter's satellite Ganymede from a distance of 5 million miles (8.025 million kilometers) early on the morning of Feb. 26. Ganymede is the largest of Jupiter's 13 satellites. It is slightly larger than the planet Mercury, and has a density about twice that of water. That leads scientists to believe it is composed of a mixture of rock and ice. Ganymede is about four times brighter than Earth's Moon, and ground-based observations indicate a surface of water frost or ice. Details of the surface are not easily interpreted. The bright spot near the center of the picture is five times brighter than the Moon, and may contain more than surrounding areas. The bright pattern around the spot reminds scientists of ray craters on the Moon and Mercury, and the area may in fact be an impact crater that has exposed fresh, underlying ice. Further interpretation will require higher-resolution pictures. This color photo was taken through blue, green and orange filters and was assembled in the Image Processing Lab at Jet Propulsion Laboratory."
Io,1999-08-13,PIA02201,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02201,"This Voyager 1 view of an equatorial region near longitude 300 degrees shows several large surface flows that originate in volcanic craters or calderas. At the right edge is a light flow about 250 kilometers long. Another dark, lobate flow with bright edges is just left of center, with an exceedingly dark caldera to its left."
Volcanic Caldera on Io,1979-03-05,PIA00021,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00021,"This photograph of Jupiter's satellite Io shows what appears to be a volcanic caldera that is venting gasses (the bright blue patch at left center). In the photo is a network of volcanic calderas with dark floors linked by bright red materials. The northernmost caldera has a bright blue patch on the floor. Scientists believe the bright blue patch may be clouds of gas issuing from volcanic vents. The gas clouds may condense to form extremely fine particles that appear blue. Since Voyager 1's infrared spectrometer has discovered sulfur dioxide on Io, it is possible that sulfur dioxide is the main component of the clouds. Sulfur dioxide clouds would rapidly freeze and snow back to the surface. It is also possible that dark areas in the floors of the calderas are pools of molten sulfur, a very dark form of sulfur. The picture was taken March 5, 1979, as Voyager 1 approached Io. Photo was taken from 80,500 miles (129,600 kilometers)."
Saturn – Ribbon-like Wave Structure in Atmosphere,1980-11-10,PIA00027,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00027,"A view of Saturn's clouds extending from 40` to 60` N latitude shows a ribbon-like wave structure in the south with small convective features marking a westward jet in the north. This image was obtained on November 10, 1980 when Voyager 1 was at a distance of 3,500,000 kilometers (2,200,000 miles) from Saturn. The smallest resolved features in this photograph are 65 kilometers (40 miles) in diameter. Images with similar resolution indicate that Saturn's circulation is somewhat different from Jupiter's. The maximum westward velocities seen on Saturn are located in the middle of the darker regions, while on Jupiter they are located at the poleward interface between belts and zones."
Io Surface Deposits and Volcano,1979-03-05,PIA00361,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00361,"This color picture of Io, Jupiter's innermost Galilean satellite, was taken by Voyager 1 on the morning of March 5, 1979 at a range of 128,500 kilometers (77,100 miles). It is centered at 8 south latitude and 317 longitude. The width of the picture is about 1000 kilometers (600 miles). The diffuse reddish and orangish colorations are probably surface deposits of sulfur compounds, salts and possibly other volcanic sublimates. The dark spot with the irregular radiating pattern near the bottom of the picture may be a volcanic crater with radiating lava flows."
Northern Hemisphere of Saturn,1980-11-05,PIA02230,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02230,"This image of the northern hemisphere of Saturn was taken by NASA's Voyager 1 on Nov. 5, 1980 at a range of 9 million kilometers (5.5 million miles) shows a variety of features in Saturn's clouds: Small-scale convective cloud features are visible in the dark belt (center); an isolated convective cloud with a dark ring is seen in the lighter zone; and a longitudinal wave is visible in the brighter zone (right of center belt). The smallest features visible in this photograph are 175 kilometers (108.7 miles) across."
Solar System Portrait - Earth,1990-02-14,PIA02228,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02228,"This image of the Earth is one of 60 frames taken by the Voyager 1 spacecraft on Feb. 14, 1990 from a distance of approximately 4 billion miles and about 32 degrees above the ecliptic plane. This image the Earth is a mere point of light, a crescent only 0.12 pixel in size. Our planet was caught in the center of one of the scattered light rays resulting from taking the image so close to the sun."
Saturn Approach - Full Disk,1980-10-18,PIA02225,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02225,"NASA's Voyager 1 took this photograph of Saturn on Oct. 18, 1980,34 million kilometers (21.1 million miles) from the planet. The photograph was taken on the last day that Saturn and its rings could be captured within a single narrow-angle camera frame as the spacecraft closed in on the planet for its nearest approach on Nov. 12. Dione, one of Saturn's inner satellites, appears as three color spots just below the planet's south pole. An abundance of previously unseen detail is apparent in the rings. For example, a gap in the dark, innermost ring, called the C-ring or crepe ring, is clearly shown. Material is seen within the relatively wide Cassini Division, separating the middle, B-ring from the outermost ring, the A-ring. The Encke Division is shown near the outer edge of the A-ring. The detail in the rings' shadows cast on the planet is of particular interest: the broad, dark band near the equator is the shadow of the B-ring; the thinner, brighter line is just to the south of the shadow of the less dense A-ring."
Ganymede - high resolution,2000-01-04,PIA02233,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02233,"This picture of Ganymede was taken on the afternoon of March 5, from a range of 272,000 kilometers. The center of the picture lies at 13 latitude, 359 longitude. Many bright impact craters are shown that have radial ejecta patterns. These rays lie across and therefore are younger than the bright and dark background material. Many older impact craters are shown that have lost their rays probably by impact erosion. The bright background areas contain grooves and ridges that may be caused by faulting of the surface materials."
Io - High Res Limb,2000-01-04,PIA02232,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02232,"This picture of Io was taken on the morning of March 5 at a rang eof 75,445 kilometers. The area shown is at latitude 15 south longitude 244 . Many depressions and elevations are shown. The light is coming from the left, so a depression has a bright right wall and shadow on the left wall. The depressions are complex in shape and do not resemble impact craters. Two of the depressions are joined by a shallow trough. The elevations are irregular and comical. They are cut by linear and irregular troughs. The surface is smooth and plain-like, that is, the surface is not pockmarked by abundant impact craters so are probably geologically young."
Io - high resolution,1979-03-05,PIA02231,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02231,"This picture of Io was taken by Voyager 1 on the morning of March 5, 1979 at a range of about 92,000 km (55,000 mi.). The view is of the terminator region centered at 60 degrees south latitude and 276 degrees longitude. North is toward the upper left-hand corner of the picture. The Sun is shining from lower-left to upper-left. Shadows cast by cliffs are clearly visible near the terminator. The long valley which parallels the terminator is about 300 km long and 50 km wide. It may be a fault trough due to crustal deformation. Other cliffs which parallel the trough may also be faults. The large bright patch in the lower left portion of the picture, and the two black spots are probably some type of surface deposits."
Saturn’s Red Spot,1980-11-06,PIA02239,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02239,"This false color image, taken on November 6, 1980 from a distance of about 8 million kilometers, shows somewhat similar, although much smaller, red spot on Saturn. False color was used to make the faint spot more visible."
Dione,2000-02-09,PIA02244,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02244,"Dione, seen here against the disk of Saturn, is a bright, white, icy object like the other inner satellites. There is a difference in character between its leading and trailing hemispheres; the trailing side, seen on the left in this image, shows a pattern of bright wispy streaks against a darker background."
Mosaic of Saturn’s Rings,2000-02-07,PIA02242,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02242,"This detailed mosaic of the underside of the Cassini Division was obtained by Voyager 1 with a resolution of about 10 kilometers. The classical Cassini Division appears here to the right of center as five bright rings with substantial blacks gap on either side. The inner edge of the A Ring, to the left of center, is the brightest part of this image. The fine-scale wave structure in this region has been interpreted as being the result of gravitational density waves."
Saturn’s Moon Rhea,1980-11-12,PIA02240,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02240,"NASA's Voyager 1 took this high resolution color image of Rhea just before the spacecraft's closest approach to the Saturnian moon on Nov. 12, 1980 from a range of 128,000 kilometers (79,500 miles). The area shown is one of the most heavily cratered on Rhea, and indicates an ancient surface dating back to the period immediately following the formation of the planets 4.5 billion years ago. The photograph shows surface features about 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in diameter, similar to a view of Earth's Moon through a telescope. Other areas of Rhea's surface are deficient in the very large (100 kilometers or 62 miles or larger) craters, indicating a change in the nature of the impacting bodies and an early period of surface activity. White areas on the edges of several of the craters in the upper right corner are probably fresh ice exposed on steep slopes or possibly deposited by volatiles leaking from fractured regions."
Saturn’s Rings,2000-02-07,PIA02241,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02241,"When seen from the unlit side, the rings of Saturn present a much different appearance from that familiar to telescopic observers. Relatively opaque areas like the B Ring turn black, while lightly populated zones, such as the C Ring and the Cassini Division, prove to excellent diffuse transmitters of sunlight. The A Ring, with intermediate opacity, is at an intermediate level of brightness."
Io,2000-03-23,PIA02248,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02248,"This photo of Io, innermost of the four large Galilean satellites of Jupiter, was taken through an ultraviolet filter by the narrow angle camera of Voyager 1. The photo was taken at 2 a.m. (PST) Feb. 27, when Voyager 1 was 4.3 million miles (7 million kilometers) from Io, seen against the background of a part of Jupiter's disk. North is at the top, and the central longitude of Io is 180 degrees. Io shows a contrasting surface, with generally very dark polar areas and numerous light and dark regions around the equator. At this resolution (about 100 miles or 160 kilometers), no topographic features, such as craters, can be seen. The brighter regions are believed to contain sulfur and various salts, making Io highly reflective (about six times brighter than Earth's Moon) in visible and enhanced light. This satellite of Jupiter has almost exactly the same size and density as our own Moon, but it apparently has followed a very different evolutionary path, influenced by its proximity to Jupiter and the intense bombardment it receives from the Jovian radiation belts of energetic charged particles."
Titan’s Thick Haze Layer,1980-11-11,PIA02238,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02238,"Titan's thick haze layer is shown in this enhanced Voyager 1 image taken Nov. 12, 1980 at a distance of 435,000 kilometers (270,000 miles). Voyager images of Saturn's largest moon show Titan completely enveloped by haze that merges with a darker ""hood"" or cloud layer over the north pole. Such a mantle is not present at the south pole. At Voyager's closest approach to Titan on Nov. 11, 1980, spacecraft instruments found that the moon has a substantial atmosphere, far denser than that of Mars and possibly denser than Earth's."
Jupiter’s Ring,1979-03-04,PIA02251,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02251,"First evidence of a ring around the planet Jupiter is seen in this photograph taken by Voyager 1 on March 4, 1979. The multiple exposure of the extremely thin faint ring appears as a broad light band crossing the center of the picture. The edge of the ring is 1,212,000 km from the spacecraft and 57,000 km from the visible cloud deck of Jupiter. The background stars look like broken hair pins because of spacecraft motion during the 11 minute 12 second exposure. The wavy motion of the star trails is due to the ultra-slow natural oscillation of the spacecraft (with a period of 78 seconds). The black dots are geometric calibration points in the camera. The ring thickness is estimated to be 30 km or less. The photograph was part of a sequence planned to search for such rings in Jupiter's equatorial plane. The ring has been invisible from Earth because of its thinness and its transparency when viewed at any angle except straight on."
Io - Southern Hemisphere,2000-03-23,PIA02250,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02250,"This picture of part of the southern hemisphere of Io was taken at a range of 74,675 km and shows an area at the terminator, very close to the edge of the disk as viewed from the spacecraft. In the foreground is gently undulating topography, while in the back-ground are two mountains with their near faces brightly illuminated by the sun. The mountain in the right is approximately 150 km across at its base and its height is probably in excess of 15 km which would make it higher than any mountain on Earth. The origin of the feature is not known but it could be a large volcano. In the foreground are numerous irregular markings which are typical of much of the surface of Io seen so far."
Ganymede,2000-03-23,PIA02252,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02252,"This view of Ganymede was taken on the afternoon of March 5 from a range of 267,000 kilometers (167,000 miles). A bright rayed impact crater is prominent on the left side of the frame. The ejecta material extends for a thousand kilometers (600 miles). The rays are on top and therefore are younger than the brighter ridged and grooved terrain crossing the picture. These features may be breaks in the surface caused by faulting. Many older craters are visible that have lost their rays."
Io - South Pole,2000-03-23,PIA02249,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02249,"This image was acquired by Voyager 1 as it approached close passage by the south pole of Io, the innermost of the four large Galilean satellites. This image was acquired at a range of 82,500 kilometers and shows an area approximately 600 km (350 miles) on a side. The sun shines from the left about 45 above the horizon as seen from the surface. The region shown is in Io's equatorial region and contains a myriad of complex features. A variety of features are visible: mountain and plateaus bounded by scarps that vary from irregular to linear, vast smooth plains, rough bright areas that may evidence curious erosion."
Voyager 1 Red Spot Movie,2000-04-06,PIA02259,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02259,This movie shows the portion of Jupiter around the Great Red Spot as it swirls through more than 60 Jupiter days. Notice the difference in speed and direction of the various zones of the atmosphere. The interaction of the atmospheric clouds and storm shows how dynamic the Jovian atmosphere is.
Voyager 1 Jupiter Southern Hemisphere Movie,1979-02-01,PIA02258,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02258,"This movie shows a portion of Jupiter in the southern hemisphere over 17Jupiter days. Above the white belt, notice the series of atmospheric vortices headed west. Even these early approach frames show wild dynamics in the roiling environment south of the white belt. Notice the small tumbling white cloud near the center."
Rhea - Icy Cratered Surface,1980-11-12,PIA02273,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02273,"The icy, cratered surface of Saturn's moon Rhea is seen in this image taken by Voyager 1 on Nov. 12, 1980, at a range of 85,000 kilometers (52,800 miles) as the spacecraft passed over the satellite's north pole. The heavily cratered surface attests to the satellite's ancient age. The largest craters, 50 to 100 kilometers (30 to 60 miles) across and several kilometers deep, are freshly preserved in Rhea's icy crust. The craters and landscape resemble those on the Moon and Mercury, and are unlike the flattened crater forms that have collapsed in the soft icy crusts of the Jovian moons Callisto, Ganymede and Europa. Scientists believe that Rhea (which is just 1,600 kilometers or 995 miles in diameter, compared to the 5,500-kilometer or 3,400-mile diameter of Ganymede) froze and became rigid, behaving like a rocky surface, very early in its history."
Saturn’s F-ring,1980-11-12,PIA02272,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02272,"The three separate components of Saturn's F-ring are seen in this image taken by NASA's Voyager l on Nov. 12, 1980, from a range of 750,000 kilometers (466,000) miles. Two prominent bright strands appear twisted and kinked, while the fainter, innermost third strand largely lacks such non-uniformities. The kinking appearance of the ring may be caused by the gravitational perturbations of two nearby satellites -- S-13 on the outside and S-14 on the inside -- or the effect may be caused by electromagnetic forces upon small F-ring particles."
Crescent of Saturn,1980-11-13,PIA02271,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02271,"The crescent of Saturn, the planet's rings and their shadows are seen in this Voyager 1 image taken Nov. 13, 1980 at a distance of 1,500,000 kilometers (930,000 miles) as the spacecraft began to leave the Saturn system. The bright limb of Saturn is clearly visible through the A, B, and C rings. The dark band cutting through the crescent is the shadow of the rings. This image was overexposed to bring out detail in the rings, so the crescent appears artificially brighter."
Callisto Basin,1979-03-06,PIA02277,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02277,"This picture of a multi-ring basin on Callisto was taken the morning of March 6, 1979, from a distance of about 200,000 km. The complicated circular structure seen at left center is similar to the large circular impact basins that dominate the surface of the Earth's moon and also the planet Mercury. The inner parts of these basins are generally surrounded by radially lineated ejecta and several concentric mountainous ring structures that are thought to form during the impact event. This multi-ring basin on Callisto consists of light floored central basin some 300 km in diameter surrounded by at least eight to ten discontinuous rhythmically spaced ridges. No radially lineated ejecta can be seen. The ring structures on Moon and Mercury have been likened to ripples produced on a pond by a rock striking the water. The great number of rings observed around this basin on Callisto is consistent with its low planetary density and probable low internal strength."
Ganymede,1979-03-05,PIA02279,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02279,"On the afternoon of March 5, 1979, Voyager 1 took this picture of Ganymede, Jupiter's largest satellite, from a range of 246,000 km (158,400 mi). The center of the picture is at 19 south latitude and 356 longitude, and the height of the frame represents a distance of about 1000 km (600 mi) on the surface. The smallest features seen on this picture are about 2.5 km (1.5 mi) across. The surface displays numerous impact craters many of which have extensive bright ray systems. The craters lacking ray systems are probably older than those showing rays. Bright bands traverse the surface in various directions and these bright bands contain an intricate system of alternating linear bright and dark lines which may represent deformation of the crusted ice layer. These lineations are particularly evident near the top of the picture. A bright band trending in a north-south direction in the lower left-hand portion of the picture is offset along a bright line. This offset is probably due to faulting. Two light circular areas in the right upper center of the picture may be the scars of ancient impact craters which have had their topographic expansion erased by flowage of the crystal icy material."
Io Caldera,1979-03-05,PIA02288,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02288,"Voyager 1 took this narrow-angle camera image on 5 March 1979 from a distance of 69,000 kilometers. The feature shown is a volcanic caldera which may be actively spewing material into space (dark gray fuzz near the upper-right part of the caldera rim). In addition, very dark lava has flowed out of the fissure and spread on the floor of the caldera. The Voyager Project is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for NASA's Office of Space Science."
Saturn’s B rings,1980-11-03,PIA02289,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02289,This narrow-angle camera image of Saturn's B Ring and Cassini Division was taken through the Clear filter from a distance of 12.6 million km on 3 November 1980. The Cassini Division separating the A and B Rings is clearly not an empty region. The Division shows several substantial well-defined ringlets.
Saturn’s F Ring,2000-05-25,PIA02283,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02283,"Saturn's F, or outermost ring was photographed from the un-illuminated face of the rings by Voyager 1 at a range of 750,000 kilometers (470,000 miles). Complex structure is evident, with several components seen. Two narrow, braided, bright rings that trace distinct orbits are evident. Visible is a broader, very diffuse component about 35 kilometers (20 miles) in width. Also seen are ""knots,"" which probably are local clumps of ring material, but may be mini-moons."
Io,1979-03-05,PIA02280,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02280,"This picture of Io, Jupiter's innermost Galilean satellite, was taken by Voyager 1 on the morning of March 5, 1979, during the closest approach to this satellite. The picture was recorded on the onboard tape recorder and then sent back to Earth on the morning of March 7, 1979. Voyager 1 was at a range of 30,800 km (18,480 mi) from Io when the picture was taken. This region of Io is centered at 67 degrees south latitude and 328 degrees longitude. The picture width is about 246 km (147 mi). The smallest features visible are about 0.3 km (0.2 mi) across. The picture shows an irregularly shaped composite crater about 50 km (30 mi) in diameter with dark flows radiating from its rim. The crater is a volcanic caldera and the dark flows are probably low viscosity lavas possibly of basaltic composition. Some of the lava flows are over 100 km long and 15 km wide. Similar but smaller flows and craters occur on the island of Hawaii."
Ganymede Varied Terrain,1979-03-05,PIA02286,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02286,"Voyager 2 took this picture of Ganymede on 5 March 1979. It was taken with the narrow-angle camera from a range of 270,000 kilometers. Clear examples of several of the different types of terrain common on Ganymede's surface are visible. The broad light regions running through the older dark areas are the typical grooved structures seen within most of the light regions on Ganymede. Many examples of craters of all ages can be seen in this image, including fresh, bright ray craters, large, subdued circular markings thought to be the ""scars"" of large ancient impacts and craters with thin, bright rims a small central crater. The Voyager Project is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for NASA's Office of Space Science."
Io Pele Plume,1979-03-05,PIA02287,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02287,"Voyager 1 took this narrow-angle camera image on 5 March 1979 from a distance of 450,000 kilometers. At this geometry, the camera looks straight down through a volcanic plume at one of Io's most active volcanos, Pele. The large heart-shaped feature is the region where Pele's plume falls to the surface. At the center of the ""heart"" is the small dark fissure that is the source of the eruption. The Voyager Project is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for NASA's Office of Space Science."
Saturn’s Satellite 1980S1,1980-11-12,PIA02284,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02284,"Two satellites of Saturn share an orbit 151,400 kilometers (94,075 miles) from the center of the planet. The leading co-orbital satellite, designated 1980S1, is seen in transit across Saturn in this image taken by NASA's Voyager 1 on Nov. 12, 1980, at a range of 611,000 kilometers (379,650 miles). It is ellipsoidal, almost disk-shaped, and rotates with its long axis, 200 kilometers (125 miles) in diameter, pointed at Saturn."
Saturn’s Shadow Upon the Rings,2000-05-25,PIA02285,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02285,"Voyager 2 returned this wide-angle, clear-filtered image of the shadow of Saturn upon the rings just after engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory successfully commanded the camera platform to point to the planet. Problems with the platform had prevented the spacecraft from returning photographs the past few days. This first picture after the repair was obtained the evening of Aug. 28, when Voyager 2 was 3.2 million kilometers (2 million miles) from the planet and racing away at more than 26,000 mph. Saturn's nightside can be seen at upper left, with the shadow cast by the planet falling across the rings in the center of this image. The white lines, or ""noise,"" across the photograph are the result of temporary ground communications troubles between the Australian Deep Space Network tracking station and Voyager mission control in Pasadena. The picture was received in Australia in perfect condition; the noise will be removed in subsequent processing."
Iapetus,1980-11-15,PIA02291,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02291,"This narrow-angle camera image of Saturn's mysterious satellite Iapetus was taken through the Clear filter from a distance of 2.5 million km on 15 November 1980. The dramatic brightness change between hemispheres is clearly seen here. Even with the bright side overexposed, the dark surface is still not visible."
Saturn’s F-Ring,1980-11-08,PIA02293,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02293,This narrow-angle camera image of Saturn's F Ring was taken through the Clear filter while at a distance of 6.9 million km from Saturn on 8 November 1980. The brightness variations of this tightly-constrained ring shown here indicate that the ring is less uniform in makeup than the larger rings.
Saturn’s F-Ring,1980-11-12,PIA02292,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02292,This narrow-angle camera image of Saturn's F Ring was taken through the Clear filter while at a distance of 0.75 million km from Saturn on 12 November 1980. The kinks and braids of this tightly-constrained ring are visible along with the outer edge of the A Ring.
"Saturn’s 15th moon, 1980S28",1980-11-06,PIA02263,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02263,"Voyager 1 has found a 15th moon orbiting Saturn, visible near the bottom of this picture taken on Nov. 6, 1980, when the spacecraft was still 8 million kilometers (5 million miles) from Saturn. Voyager imaging team scientists discovered the moon Nov. 7, 1980, in the first of several programmed searches for new satellites of Saturn. The unique location of the 15th satellite, just 800 kilometers (500 miles) outside the outer edge of the A-ring, is especially significant in that this small body, approximately 100 kilometers (50 miles) in diameter, may be responsible for defining the outer edge of Saturn's bright ring system. The orbital period of the new satellite is approximately 14 hours, 20 minutes, the shortest orbit of any of Saturn's known satellites. The very narrow F-ring, approximately 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) outside the outer edge of the A-ring, is seen prominently in this picture."
Rhea,1980-11-10,PIA02264,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02264,"Broad areas of light and dark material seen in this enhanced Voyager 1 picture of Saturn's satellite Rhea suggest varying amounts of fresh ice on the moon's surface. A few small bright spots are visible and are similar in appearance to small fresh impact craters seen in Voyager images of the Galilean satellites of Jupiter taken at this resolution. The photograph, taken Nov. 10, 1980 at a range of 2.7 million kilometers (1.6 million miles), shows features about 50 kilometers (30 miles) in scale. Near the terminator (lower right) are several features which indicate topographic relief. The two circular features may be large impact craters perhaps a hundred kilometers (60 miles) across. (The extreme brightness of the southern (lower left) region is probably not real and is a result of image processing.) Rhea is one of the larger of Saturn's inner satellites with a diameter of about 1,500 kilometers (900 miles) and is known to be covered at least partially with water frost. It may be mostly icy in nature."
Dione - Circular Impact Craters,2000-05-23,PIA02265,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02265,"Circular impact craters up to about 100 kilometers (60 miles) in diameter are seen in this view of Saturn's icy moon Dione. The image was taken by Voyager 1 from a range of 790,000 kilometers (500,000 miles) at 2:20 a.m. PST on November 12. Bright, wispy markings form complex arcuate patterns on the surface. These markings are slightly brighter than the brightest features seen by Voyager on Jupiter's moons, suggesting that they are surface frost deposits. The patterns of the bright bands hint at an origin due to internal geologic activity, but the resolution is not yet sufficient to prove or disprove this idea. Dione's diameter is only 1100 kilometers (700 miles), much smaller than any of Jupiter's icy moons. It thus belongs to a class of small, icy objects never observed before the Voyager I Saturn encounter. The view here is of the face which trails in orbit."
Mimas - Large Impact Structure,2000-05-23,PIA02266,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02266,"This Voyager 1 picture of Mimas shows a large impact structure at 110 W Long., located on that face of the moon which leads Mimas in its orbit. The feature, about 130 kilometers in diameter (80 miles), is more than one-quarter the diameter of the entire moon. This is a particularly interesting feature in view of its large diameter compared with the size of the satellite, and may have the largest crater diameter/satellite diameter ratio in the solar system. The crater has a raised rim and central peak, typical of large impact structures on terrestrial planets. Additional smaller craters, 15-45 kilometers in diameter, can be seen scattered across the surface, particularly along the terminator. This photo was taken on November 12 at 5:05 a.m. PST, from a range of approximately 660,000 kilometers (400,000 miles). Mimas is one of the smaller Saturnian satellites with a low density implying its chief component is ice."
Mimas - cratered surface,1980-11-12,PIA02267,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02267,"This image of Saturn's moon Mimas was taken by NASA's Voyager 1 on Nov. 12, 1980 and shows the heavily and uniformly cratered surface of the satellite. The photograph, taken at a range of 208,000 kilometers (129,000 miles), shows features as small as about five kilometers (three miles). Topography is best seen along the terminator where it is enhanced by the low sun angle. The apparent crater density decrease toward the left of the picture is not real and results from a change in sun angle. A long, narrow trough about five kilometers (three miles) across is seen to cross from lower limb to the center of the image where it terminates. A second trough originates near the center and extends to the upper limb, where it appears to branch into a series of smaller troughs."
Iapetus,1980-11-12,PIA02268,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02268,"A large circular feature about 200 kilometers (120 miles) across with a dark spot in its center is visible in this photograph of Saturn's satellite Iapetus taken Nov. 12, 1980 from a distance of 3.2 million kilometers (1.9 million miles). The satellite's leading hemisphere is to the left, and the trailing hemisphere, which is about four to five times brighter, is to the right. The large circular feature is most probably a large impact structure outlined by dark material, possibly thrown out by the impact."
Saturn’s Ring System,1980-11-12,PIA02269,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02269,"Eight hours after its closest approach to Saturn on Nov. 12, 1980, Voyager 1 took this picture of the planet's ring system. Major features of the rings are clearly seen: from the top of the image down is the bright F-ring, the A-ring, the Cassini Division, the broad B-ring, and the C-ring (dark gray area). The spacecraft took this picture at a distance of 720,000 kilometers (446,000 miles) from an angle approximately 30 degrees above the ring plane. The unique lighting in this view brings out the many hundreds of bright and dark ringlets that make up this very thin, phonograph record-like ring system. The dark spokelike features seen in images taken during approach to Saturn now appear as bright streaks, indicating that they possess a strong forward-scattering property."
Ganymede,1979-03-05,PIA02278,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02278,"This picture of Ganymede, Jupiter's largest satellite, was taken by Voyager 1 on the afternoon of March 5, 1979 from a range of 253,000 kilometers (151,800 miles). The picture is centered at 66 south latitude and 3 longitude and shows the south western limb region of Ganymede. The smallest features visible are about 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) across. The surface shows numerous impact craters, many of which have extensive bright ray systems. Light bands traversing the surface contain alternating bright and dark lines which probably represent deformation of the icy central material."
Rhea - Multiple Impact Craters,1980-11-12,PIA02270,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02270,"Multiple impact craters are seen on the ancient surface of Saturn's moon Rhea in this picture taken by Voyager 1 on Nov. 12, 1980 at a range of 73,000 kilometers (45,000 miles). The craters closely resemble those on Mercury and Earth's Moon. Many of the craters have central peaks formed by rebound of the floor during the explosive formation of the crater. The craters are old and degraded by later impacts. Crater diameters seen are as large as approximately 75 kilometers (45 miles). Many have sharp rims and appear relatively fresh while others are very shallow and have subdued rims, indicative of their antiquity."
Io 2x2 Mosaic,2000-06-08,PIA02294,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02294,"Perhaps the most spectacular of all the Voyager photos of Io is this mosaic obtained by Voyager 1 on March 5 at a range of 400,000 kilometers. A great variety of color and albedo is seen on the surface, now thought to be the result of surface deposits of various forms of sulfur and sulfur dioxide. The two great volcanoes Pele and Loki (upper left) are prominent."

Voyager Approaches Final Frontier (Artist’s Concept),2003-12-12,PIA04927,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA04927,"An artist's concept illustrates the positions of the Voyager spacecraft in relation to structures formed around our Sun by the solar wind. Also illustrated is the termination shock, a violent region the spacecraft must pass through before reaching the outer limits of the solar system. At the termination shock, the supersonic solar wind abruptly slows from an average speed of 400 kilometers per second to less than 100 kilometer per second (900,000 to less than 225,000 miles per hour). Beyond the termination shock is the solar system's final frontier, the heliosheath, a vast region where the turbulent and hot solar wind is compressed as it presses outward against the interstellar wind that is beyond the heliopause. A bow shock likely forms as the interstellar wind approaches and is deflected around the heliosphere, forcing it into a teardrop-shaped structure with a long, comet-like tail."

Magnetic Field Line Pile-Up (Artist’s Concept),2013-02-12,PIA16734,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA16734,"This artist's concept shows NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft in a new region at the edge of our solar system where the magnetic field lines generated by our sun are piling up and intensifying. Voyager 1 is in an area scientists are calling the depletion region where the magnetic field acts as a kind of ""magnetic highway."" In this region, energetic ions from inside the heliosphere, the magnetic bubble that the sun blows around itself, escape out, and energetic ions from interstellar space zoom in. (To learn more about how this region acts as a magnetic highway, see PIA16486.) The depletion region is the outermost known layer of the heliosphere."
Transitional Regions at the Heliosphere’s Outer Limits,2012-08-25,PIA17034,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17034,"This artist's concept shows NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft exploring a region called the ""depletion region"" or ""magnetic highway"" at the outer limits of our heliosphere, the bubble the sun blows around itself. In this region, the magnetic field lines generated by our sun (yellow arcs) are piling up and intensifying and low-energy charged particles that are accelerated in the heliosphere's turbulent outer layer (green dots) have disappeared. Scientists think the depletion region is the last region Voyager 1 has to cross before reaching interstellar space, which is the space between stars. Voyager 1 passed a shockwave known as the termination shock in 2004, where solar wind suddenly slowed down and became turbulent. In 2010, it then passed into an area called the ""stagnation region"" where the outward velocity of the solar wind slowed to zero and sporadically reversed direction. In the slow-down and stagnation regions, the prevalence of low-energy charged particles from our heliosphere jumped dramatically and is indicated by the green dots."
Voyager Signal Spotted By Earth Radio Telescopes,2013-02-21,PIA17047,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17047,"The signal of NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft -- the most distant human-made object -- has been spotted from Earth by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's 5,000-mile-wide (8,000-kilometer-wide) Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), which links radio telescopes from Hawaii to St. Croix."

Voyager 1 Entering Interstellar Space (Artist Concept),2013-09-12,PIA17462,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17462,"This artist's concept depicts NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft entering interstellar space, or the space between stars. Interstellar space is dominated by the plasma, or ionized gas, that was ejected by the death of nearby giant stars millions of years ago. The environment inside our solar bubble is dominated by the plasma exhausted by our sun, known as the solar wind."
Voyager Goes Interstellar (Artist Concept),2012-08-25,PIA17046,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17046,"This artist's concept puts solar system distances in perspective. The scale bar is in astronomical units, with each set distance beyond 1 AU representing 10 times the previous distance. One AU is the distance from the sun to the Earth, which is about 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers. Neptune, the most distant planet from the sun, is about 30 AU."
Mystery of the Interstellar Magnetic Field (Artist’s Concept),2013-09-12,PIA17442,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17442,"Scientists expected Voyager 1 to measure magnetic field lines traveling in the directions shown by the artist's concept at left, as it crossed into interstellar space. Instead the spacecraft detected much less dramatic changes to the magnetic field lines as indicated by the data on right."
Observed Change in Density Shows Voyager is in Interstellar Space,2013-09-12,PIA17441,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17441,"How did scientists know that Voyager entered interstellar space? An increase in the density of charged particles was the key piece of evidence. Our sun sits in a bubble, called the heliosphere, carved out by wind emitted from the hot sun. Beyond this bubble, within which all the planets orbit, is interstellar space -- the region filled with plasma and neutral gas between the stars. In this local region of interstellar space, the gas is warm and filled with a mixture of charged particles and neutral hydrogen that are much more dense than the diluted solar wind inside the bubble."
Moving into Interstellar Space (Artist Concept),2013-09-12,PIA17460,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17460,"This artist's concept shows the outer layers of our solar bubble, or heliosphere, and nearby interstellar space. NASA's Voyager 1 is currently exploring a region of interstellar space, which is the space between stars that still feels charged particle and magnetic field influences from the heliosphere. The magnetic field lines (yellow arcs) appear to lie in the same general direction as the magnetic field lines emanating from our sun."

Solar and Interstellar Magnetic Fields (Artist’s Concept),2012-12-03,PIA16485,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA16485,"This artist's concept shows the different expected directions of the magnetic fields in interstellar space (black lines) and the magnetic field emanating from our sun (white lines). NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft is traveling northward out of the heliosphere, which is the bubble of charged particles the sun blows around itself. Voyager 2 is traveling southward out of the heliosphere."
Low-Energy Charged Particle Instrument Assembly,2012-12-03,PIA16487,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA16487,"This image shows the low-energy charged particle instrument before it was installed on one of NASA's Voyager spacecraft in 1977. The instrument includes a stepper motor that turns the platform on which the sensors are mounted, so that the field of view rotates through 360 degrees. This motor was tested for 500,000 steps, enough to reach the orbit of Saturn, and has now completed over 6 million steps. The old-fashioned capacitor bank underneath the motor stores energy needed to provide a 15.7-watt pulse every 192 seconds."

Low-Energy Particles Leaking out of the Solar System (Artist’s Concept),2011-12-16,PIA15176,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA15176,"This artist's concept shows NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft in a new region at the edge of our solar system where there are fewer low energy particles that originate from inside our solar system. Voyager 1 is in an area scientists are calling the stagnation region, at the outer layer of the heliosphere, or magnetic bubble that the sun blows around itself. Voyager 1 passed the termination shock in 2004 into the heliosheath, where the solar wind dramatically slows down and becomes turbulent. That area has the highest bombardment of higher energy particles from inside our solar system and their intensity held steady until mid-2010, when they sharply diminished to half the amount. The reduction indicates that these particles may be leaking to interstellar space and the spacecraft is nearing the space between stars."
Energetic Particles from Outside our Solar System Increase (Artist’s Concept),2011-12-16,PIA15177,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA15177,"This artist's concept shows NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft in a new region at the edge of our solar system where the amount of high-energy particles diffusing into our solar system from outside has increased. Voyager 1 is in an area scientists are calling the stagnation region, at the outer layer of the heliosphere, or magnetic bubble that the sun blows around itself. These energetic particles, which are cosmic rays in interstellar space, have increased 100 times between the time Voyager 1 passed the termination shock in 2004 and mid-2010, when the spacecraft entered the new region. The termination shock is where the solar wind dramatically slows down and becomes turbulent. The spacecraft has detected a steadily increasing abundance of the cosmic ray particles since Voyager 1 first crossed the termination shock. The increase indicates that Voyager 1 is approaching interstellar space."
Voyager 1 Encounters Stagnation Region (Artist’s Concept),2011-12-05,PIA15173,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA15173,"NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft has entered a new region between our solar system and interstellar space, which scientists are calling the stagnation region. In the stagnation region, the wind of charged particles streaming out from our sun has slowed and turned inward for the first time, our solar system's magnetic field has piled up and higher-energy particles from inside our solar system appear to be leaking out into interstellar space. This image shows that the inner edge of the stagnation region is located about 113 astronomical units (10.5 billion miles or 16.9 billion kilometers) from the sun. Voyager 1 is currently about 119 astronomical units (11 billion miles or 17.8 billion kilometers) from the sun. The distance to the outer edge is unknown."
