Miranda’s Icy Face,"Uranus' icy moon Miranda is seen in this image from Voyager 2 on January 24, 1986.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA18185.jpg,1986-01-24
Uranus as seen by NASA’s Voyager 2,This is an image of the planet Uranus taken by the spacecraft Voyager 2 in 1986.,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA18182.jpg,1986-12-18
Triton’s Volcanic Plumes,"These three sequential images of an erupting volcano on Neptune's large moon Triton were taken by NASA's Voyager 2 as the spacecraft approach the moon on Aug. 26, 1989. The images, taken about 45 minutes apart (top to bottom), show the geyser-like volcanic plume spewing an eight kilometer- (five mile-) tall cloud of fine, dark particles into Triton's thin atmosphere. The cloud can be seen drifting downwind to the right for a distance of roughly 150 kilometers (about 100 miles). In the last view (bottom), the shadow of the lound cloud can be distinguished. The density of the cloud appears to increase through the sequence of images; whether this change was real or whether the cloud simply appears to grow when viewed from different angles is uncertain. Voyager scientists say one explanation for the mechanism that drives such eruptions is that sunlight absorbed by dark particles inside Triton's ice cap warms nitrogen ice, causing the pressure of nitrogen gas to increase. The pressurized gas then escapes through vents, carrying aloft with it dark, powdery particles that are left suspended to drift downwind. Triton, Eath, and Jupiter's moon Io are the only three objects in the solar system known to have active volcanos.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA14449.jpg,1989-08-26
Triton’s Dark Plume,"A several-kilometers-tall, geyser-like eruption of dark material is seen shooting almost straight up from the surface of Neptune's moon, Triton, in this Voyager 2 image, acquired on Aug. 24, 1989, from a distance of 99,920 kilometers (about 62,000 miles). This dark plume first discovered in stereo images taken by Voyager 2 consists of a narrow stem that rises vertically nearly eight kilometers (five miles), forming a cloud that drifts 150 kilometers (90 miles) westward in Triton's winds. The image shows the geyser-like column nearly in profile, as the spacecraft was only 16 degrees above the hotizon as seen from Triton's surface at the base of the plume. While Voyager scientists are still trying to determine the mechanism responsible for the eruption, one possibility being considered is that pressurized gas, probably nitrogen, rises from beneath the surface and carries aloft dark particles, probably including carbon-rich materials and possibly ice crystals. The plume carries the particles to an altitude where they are left suspended as a westward-drifting cloud. (The same image is shown in the upper and lower panels; the lower panel is marked to indicate the top and bottom of the plume, the lateral extent of the cloud, and the visible extent of the cloud's shows.)",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA14448.jpg,1989-08-24
Uranus Rings in False Color,"This false-color view of the rings of Uranus was made from images taken by Voyager 2 on Jan. 21, 1986, from a distance of 4.17 million kilometers (2.59 million miles). All nine known rings are visible here; the somewhat fainter, pastel lines seen between them are contributed by the computer enhancement. Six 15-second narrow-angle images were used to extract color information from the extremely dark and faint rings. Two images each in the green, clear and violet filters were added together and averaged to find the proper color differences between the rings. The final image was made from these three color averages and represents an enhanced, false-color view. The image shows that the brightest, or epsilon, ring at top is neutral in color, with the fainter eight other rings showing color differences between them. Moving down, toward Uranus, we see the delta, gamma and eta rings in shades of blue and green; the beta and alpha rings in somewhat lighter tones; and then a final set of three, known simply as the 4, 5 and 6 rings, in faint off-white tones. Scientists will use this color information to try to understand the nature and origin of the ring material. The resolution of this image is approximately 40 km (25 mi).",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00033.jpg,1986-01-21
Saturn With Rhea and Dione (True Color),"NASA's Voyager 2 took this 'true color' photograph of Saturn on July 21, 1981, when the spacecraft was 33.9 million kilometers (21 million miles) from the planet. Two bright, presumably convective cloud patterns are visible in the mid-northern hemisphere and several dark spoke-like features can be seen in the broad B-ring (left of planet). The moons Rhea and Dione appear as blue dots to the south and southeast of Saturn, respectively. Voyager 2 made its closest approach to Saturn on Aug. 25, 1981.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00030.jpg,1981-07-21
Titania High-Resolution Color Composite,"This high-resolution color composite of Titania was made from Voyager 2 images taken Jan. 24, 1986, as the spacecraft neared its closest approach to Uranus. Voyager's narrow-angle camera acquired this image of Titania, one of the large moons of Uranus, through the violet and clear filters. The spacecraft was about 500,000 kilometers (300,000 miles) away; the picture shows details about 9 km (6 mi) in size. Titania has a diameter of about 1,600 km (1,000 mi). In addition to many scars due to impacts, Titania displays evidence of other geologic activity at some point in its history. The large, trenchlike feature near the terminator (day-night boundary) at middle right suggests at least one episode of tectonic activity. Another, basinlike structure near the upper right is evidence of an ancient period of heavy impact activity. The neutral gray color of Titania is characteristic of the Uranian satellites as a whole.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00036.jpg,1986-01-24
Titania - Highest Resolution Voyager Picture,"This is the highest-resolution picture of Titania returned by Voyager 2. The picture is a composite of two images taken Jan. 24, 1986, through the clear filter of Voyager's narrow-angle camera. At the time, the spacecraft was 369,000 kilometers (229,000 miles) from the Uranian moon; the resolution was 13 km (8 mi). Titania is the largest satellite of Uranus, with a diameter of a little more than 1,600 km (1,000 mi). Abundant impact craters of many sizes pockmark the ancient surface. The most prominent features are fault valleys that stretch across Titania. They are up to 1,500 km (nearly 1,000 mi) long and as much as 75 km (45 mi) wide. In valleys seen at right-center, the sunward-facing walls are very bright. While this is due partly to the lighting angle, the brightness also indicates the presence of a lighter material, possibly young frost deposits. An impact crater more than 200 km (125 mi) in diameter distinguishes the very bottom of the disk; the crater is cut by a younger fault valley more than 100 km (60 mi) wide. An even larger impact crater, perhaps 300 km (180 mi) across, is visible at top.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00039.jpg,1986-01-24
Miranda - ‘Chevron’ Grooves,"This image of Miranda, obtained by Voyager 2 on approach, shows an unusual 'chevron' figure and regions of distinctly differing terrain on the Uranian moon. Voyager was 42,000 kilometers (26,000 miles) away when its narrow-angle camera acquired this clear-filter view. Grooved areas baring light and dark bands, distinct from other areas of mottled terrain, are visible at this resolution of about 600 meters (2,000 feet). The bright V-shaped feature in the grooved areas is the 'chevron' observed in earlier, lower-resolution images. Cutting across the bands are sinuous scarps, probably faults. Superimposed on both types of terrain are many bowl-shaped impact craters less than 5 km (3 mi) wide. The entire picture spans an area about 220 km (140 mi) across.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00038.jpg,1996-01-29
Ganymede Mosaic,"The hemisphere of Ganymede that faces away from the Sun displays a great variety of terrain. In this Voyager 2 mosaic, photographed at a range of 300,000 kilometers, the ancient dark area of Regio Galileo lies at the upper left. Below it, the ray system is probably caused by water-ice, splashed out in a relatively recent impact.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00081.jpg,1996-01-29
Oberon at Voyager Closest Approach,"This Voyager 2 picture of Oberon is the best the spacecraft acquired of Uranus' outermost moon. The picture was taken shortly after 3:30 a.m. PST on Jan. 24, 1986, from a distance of 660,000 kilometers (410,000 miles). The color was reconstructed from images taken through the narrow-angle camera's violet, clear and green filters. The picture shows features as small as 12 km (7 mi) on the moon's surface. Clearly visible are several large impact craters in Oberon's icy surface surrounded by bright rays similar to those seen on Jupiter's moon Callisto. Quite prominent near the center of Oberon's disk is a large crater with a bright central peak and a floor partially covered with very dark material. This may be icy, carbon-rich material erupted onto the crater floor sometime after the crater formed. Another striking topographic feature is a large mountain, about 6 km (4 mi) high, peeking out on the lower left limb.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00034.jpg,1986-01-24
"Miranda Fractures, Grooves and Craters","This Voyager 2 image of Miranda was taken Jan 24, 1986, from a distance of about 31,000 kilometers (19,000 miles), shortly before the spacecraft's closest approach to the Uranian moon. The high resolution of 600 meters (2,000 feet) reveals a bewildering variety of fractures, grooves and craters, as well as features of different albedos (reflectancea). This clear-filter, narrow-angle view encompasses areas of older, heavily cratered terrain with a wide variety of forms. The grooves and troughs reach depths of a few kilometers (or miles) and expose materials of different albedos. The great variety of directions of fractures and troughs, and the different densities of impact craters on them, signify a long, complex geologic evolution of this satellite.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00140.jpg,1986-01-24
Umbriel at Closest Approach,"The southern hemisphere of Umbriel displays heavy cratering in this Voyager 2 image, taken Jan. 24, 1986, from a distance of 557,000 kilometers (346,000 miles). This frame, taken through the clear-filter of Voyager's narrow-angle camera, is the most detailed image of Umbriel, with a resolution of about 10 km (6 mi). Umbriel is the darkest of Uranus' larger moons and the one that appears to have experienced the lowest level of geological activity. It has a diameter of about 1,200 km (750 mi) and reflects only 16 percent of the light striking its surface; in the latter respect, Umbriel is similar to lunar highland areas. Umbriel is heavily cratered but lacks the numerous bright-ray craters seen on the other large Uranian satellites; this results in a relatively uniform surface albedo (reflectivity). The prominent crater on the terminator (upper right) is about 110 km (70 mi) across and has a bright central peak. The strangest feature in this image (at top) is a curious bright ring, the most reflective area seen on Umbriel. The ring is about 140 km (90 miles) in diameter and lies near the satellite's equator. The nature of the ring is not known, although it might be a frost deposit, perhaps associated with an impact crater. Spots against the black background are due to 'noise' in the data.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00040.jpg,1986-01-24
Ariel - Highest Resolution Color Picture,"The complex terrain of Ariel is viewed in this image, the best Voyager 2 color picture of the Uranian moon. The individual photos used to construct this composite were taken Jan. 24, 1986, from a distance of 170,000 kilometers (105,000 miles. Voyager captured this view of Ariel's southern hemisphere through the green, blue and violet filters of the narrow-angle camera; the resolution is about 3 km (2 mi). Most of the visible surface consists of relatively intensely cratered terrain transected by fault scarps and fault-bounded valleys (graben). Some of the largest valleys, which can be seen near the terminator (at right), are partly filled with younger deposits that are less heavily cratered. Bright spots near the limb and toward the left are chiefly the rims of small craters. Most of the brightly rimmed craters are too small to be resolved here, although one about 30 km (20 mi) in diameter can be easily distinguished near the center. These bright-rim craters, though the youngest features on Ariel, probably have formed over a long span of geological time. Although Ariel has a diameter of only about 1,200 km (750 mi), it has clearly experienced a great deal of geological activity in the past.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00041.jpg,1986-01-24
Neptune Full Disk,"During August 16 and 17, 1989, the Voyager 2 narrow-angle camera was used to photograph Neptune almost continuously, recording approximately two and one-half rotations of the planet. These images represent the most complete set of full disk Neptune images that the spacecraft will acquire. This picture from the sequence shows two of the four cloud features which have been tracked by the Voyager cameras during the past two months. The large dark oval near the western limb (the left edge) is at a latitude of 22 degrees south and circuits Neptune every 18.3 hours. The bright clouds immediately to the south and east of this oval are seen to substantially change their appearances in periods as short as four hours. The second dark spot, at 54 degrees south latitude near the terminator (lower right edge), circuits Neptune every 16.1 hours. This image has been processed to enhance the visibility of small features, at some sacrifice of color fidelity.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00046.jpg,1996-01-29
Neptune - Changes in Great Dark Spot,"The bright cirrus-like clouds of Neptune change rapidly, often forming and dissipating over periods of several to tens of hours. In this sequence spanning two rotations of Neptune (about 36 hours) Voyager 2 observed cloud evolution in the region around the Great Dark Spot (GDS) at an effective resolution of about 100 kilometers (62 miles) per pixel. The surprisingly rapid changes which occur over the 18 hours separating each panel shows that in this region Neptune's weather is perhaps as dynamic and variable as that of the Earth. However, the scale is immense by our standards the Earth and the GDS are of similar size and in Neptune's frigid atmosphere, where temperatures are as low as 55 degrees Kelvin (360 F), the cirrus clouds are composed of frozen methane rather than Earth's crystals of water ice.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00047.jpg,1996-01-29
Miranda High Resolution of Large Fault,"This high-resolution image of Miranda was acquired by Voyager 2 on Jan. 24, 1986, when the spacecraft was 36,250 kilometers (22,500 miles) from the Uranian moon. In this clear-filter, narrow-angle image, Miranda displays a dramatically varied surface. Well shown at this resolution of 660 meters (2,160 feet) are numerous ridges and valleys -- a topography that was probably produced by compressional tectonics. Cutting across the ridges and valleys are many faults. The largest fault scarp, or cliff, is seen below and right of center; it shows grooves probably made by the contact of the fault blocks as they rubbed against each other (leaving what are known as slickensides). Movement of the down-dropped block is shown by the offset of the ridges. The fault may be 5 km (3 mi) high, or higher than the walls of the Grand Canyon on Earth.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00044.jpg,1986-01-24
Neptune - Changes in Great Dark Spot,"These images show changes in the clouds around Neptune's Great Dark Spot (GDS) over a four and one-half-day period. From top to bottom the images show successive rotations of the planet an interval of about 18 hours. The GDS is at a mean latitude of 20 degrees south, and covers about 30 degrees of longitude. The violet filter of the Voyager narrow angle camera was used to produce these images at distances ranging from 17 million kilometers (10.5 million miles) at the top, to 10 million kilometers (6.2 million miles) at bottom. The images have been mapped on to a rectangular latitude longitude grid to remove the effects of changing viewing geometry and the changing distance to Neptune. The sequence shows a large change in the western end (left side) of the GDS, where a dark extension apparent in the earlier images converges into an extended string of small dark spots over the next five rotations. This 'string of beads' extends from the GDS at a surprisingly large angle relative to horizontal lines of constant latitude. The large bright cloud at the southern (bottom) border of the GDS is a more or less permanent companion of the GDS. The apparent motion of smaller clouds at the periphery of the GDS suggests a counterclockwise rotation of the GDS reminiscent of flow around the Great Red Spot in Jupiter's atmosphere. This activity of the GDS is surprising because the total energy flux from the sun and from Neptune's interior is only 5 percent as large as the total energy flux on Jupiter.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00045.jpg,1996-01-29
Neptune - Great Dark Spot and Scooter,"This image of clouds in Neptune's atmosphere is the first that tests the accuracy of the weather forecast that was made eight days earlier to select targets for the Voyager narrow angle camera. Three of the four targeted features are visible in this photograph; all three are close to their predicted locations. The Great Dark Spot with its bright white companion is slightly to the left of center. The small bright Scooter is below and to the left, and the second dark spot with its bright core is below the Scooter. Strong eastward winds up to 400 mph cause the second dark spot to overtake and pass the larger one every five days. The spacecraft was 6.1 million kilometers (3.8 million miles) from the planet at the time of camera shuttering, and the images uses the orange, green and clear filters of the camera.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00048.jpg,1996-01-29
Miranda’s Geologic History (Variety of Terrain),"Miranda reveals a complex geologic history in this view, acquired by Voyager 2 on Jan. 24, 1986, around its close approach to the Uranian moon. At least three terrain types of different age and geologic style are evident at this resolution of about 700 meters (2,300 feet). Visible in this clear-filter, narrow-angle image are, from left: (1) an apparently ancient, cratered terrain consisting of rolling, subdued hills and degraded medium-sized craters (2) a grooved terrain with linear valleys and ridges developed at the expense of, or replacing, the first terrain type: and (3) a complex terrain seen along the terminator, in which intersecting curvilinear ridges and troughs are abruptly truncated by the linear, grooved terrain. Voyager scientists believe this third terrain type is intermediate in age between the first two.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00141.jpg,1986-01-24
Uranus’ Tenth Ring,"A newly discovered tenth ring of Uranus is barely visible near the top of this two-frame Voyager 2 mosaic. The frames composing this picture were obtained Jan. 23, 1986, from a distance of 1.12 million kilometers (690,000 miles). The tenth ring is about midway between the bright, outermost epsilon ring and the next ring down, called delta. The tenth ring, the first such feature discovered by Voyager, orbits Uranus at a radius of about 50,000 km (30,000 mi). This places the ring close to the orbit of the recently discovered 'shepherd' satellite 1986U7. All nine of the previously known rings of Uranus are visible: epsilon, delta, gamma, eta, beta, alpha, 4, 5 and 6 (from top). This image has been processed to enhance narrow features; the resolution is roughly 10 km (6 mi). Both a bright, narrow inner component and a fainter, extended outer component of the eta ring are distinct in this view. The epsilon ring -- which at this location achieves its maximum width of 100 km (60 mi) -- and the broad component of the eta ring are the only features resolved here.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00035.jpg,1986-01-23
Uranus Ring System,"This dramatic Voyager 2 picture reveals a continuous distribution of small particles throughout the Uranus ring system Voyager took this image while in the shadow of Uranus, at a distance of 236,000 kilometers (142,000 miles and a resolution of about 33 km (20 ml). This unique geometry -- the highest phase angle at which Voyager imaged the rings -- allows us to see lanes of fine dust particles not visible from other viewing angles. All the previously known rings are visible here, however, some of the brightest features in the image are bright dust lanes not previously seen. The combination of this unique geometry and a long, 96 second exposure allowed this spectacular observation, acquired through the clear filter of Voyager's wide-angle camera. The long exposure produced a noticeable, non-uniform smear as well as streaks due to trailed stars.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00142.jpg,1996-01-29
1989N1,"Voyager 2 took this image of Neptune's irregularly-shaped satellite 1989N1 from a range of 870,000 kilometers (540,000 miles). The resolution is 8 kilometers (5 miles) per pixel. The satellite has an average radius of about 200 kilometers (120 miles) and is uniformly dark with an albedo of about 6 percent. The irregular shape suggests that 1989N1 has been cold and rigid throughout its history and subject to significant impact cratering.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00055.jpg,1996-01-29
Nereid,"Nereid, the last satellite of Neptune to be discovered before Voyager's recent discoveries, was first seen by Gerard Kuiper in 1949. Until this Voyager 2 image was obtained, all that was known about Nereid was its orbital parameters and intrinsic brightness. This Voyager view of Nereid was obtained on Aug. 24, 1989 at a distance of 4.7 million kilometers (2.9 million miles). With a resolution of 43 kilometers (26.6 miles) per pixel, this image has sufficient detail to show the overall size and albedo. Nereid is about 170 kilometers (105 miles) across and reflects about 12 percent of the incident light.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00054.jpg,1989-08-24
Neptune False Color Image of Haze,"This false color photograph of Neptune was made from Voyager 2 images taken through three filters: blue, green, and a filter that passes light at a wavelength that is absorbed by methane gas. Thus, regions that appear white or bright red are those that reflect sunlight before it passes through a large quantity of methane. The image reveals the presence of a ubiquitous haze that covers Neptune in a semitransparent layer. Near the center of the disk, sunlight passes through the haze and deeper into the atmosphere, where some wavelengths are absorbed by methane gas, causing the center of the image to appear less red. Near the edge of the planet, the haze scatters sunlight at higher altitude, above most of the methane, causing the bright red edge around the planet. By measuring haze brightness at several wavelengths, scientists are able to estimate the thickness of the haze and its ability to scatter sunlight. The image is among the last full disk photos that Voyager 2 took before beginning its endless journey into interstellar space.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00057.jpg,1996-01-29
Neptune in False Color,"In this false color image of Neptune, objects that are deep in the atmosphere are blue, while those at higher altitudes are white. The image was taken by Voyager 2's wide-angle camera through an orange filter and two different methane filters. Light at methane wavelengths is mostly absorbed in the deeper atmosphere. The bright, white feature is a high altitude cloud just south of the Great Dark Spot. The hard, sharp inner boundary within the bright cloud is an artifact of computer processing on Earth. Other, smaller clouds associated with the Great Dark Spot are white or pink, and are also at high altitudes. Neptune's limb looks reddish because Voyager 2 is viewing it tangentially, and the sunlight is scattered back to space before it can be absorbed by the methane. A long, narrow band of high altitude clouds near the top of the image is located at 25 degrees north latitude, and faint hazes mark the equator and polar regions.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00051.jpg,1996-01-29
Neptune’s Southern Hemisphere,"This photograph of Neptune's southern hemisphere was taken by the narrow-angle camera on NASA's Voyager 2 when the spacecraft was 4.2 million km (2.6 million miles) from the planet. The smallest features that can be seen are 38 km (24 miles) across. The almond-shaped structure at the left is a large cloud system that has been seen for several weeks. Internal details in the feature have become increasingly apparent as Voyager 2 has approached. Systems with similar shapes in Jupiter's atmosphere rotate about their centers, rolling in the local winds that increase toward the south. However, the wispy nature of the white central clouds in this Neptunian feature make confirmation of the system's rotation difficult.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00050.jpg,1996-01-29
Neptune Rings and 1989N2,"In this Voyager wide-angle image taken on Aug. 23 1989, the two main rings of Neptune can be clearly seen. In the lower part of the frame the originally announced ring arc, consisting of three distinct features, is visible. This feature covers about 35 degrees of longitude and has yet to be radially resolved in Voyager images. From higher resolution images it is known that this region contains much more material than the diffuse belts seen elsewhere in its orbit, which seem to encircle the planet. This is consistent with the fact that ground-based observations of stellar occultations by the rings show them to be very broken and clumpy. The more sensitive wide-angle camera is revealing more widely distributed but fainter material. Each of these rings of material lies just outside of the orbit of a newly discovered moon. One of these moons, 1989N2, may be seen in the upper right corner. The moon is streaked by its orbital motion, whereas the stars in the frame are less smeared. The dark area around the bright moon and star are artifacts of the processing required to bring out the faint rings. This wide-angle image was taken from a range of 2 million kilometers (1.2 million miles), through the clear filter.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00053.jpg,1996-01-29
Neptune Clouds Showing Vertical Relief,"This Voyager 2 high resolution color image, taken 2 hours before closest approach, provides obvious evidence of vertical relief in Neptune's bright cloud streaks. These clouds were observed at a latitude of 29 degrees north near Neptune's east terminator. The linear cloud forms are stretched approximately along lines of constant latitude and the sun is toward the lower left. The bright sides of the clouds which face the sun are brighter than the surrounding cloud deck because they are more directly exposed to the sun. Shadows can be seen on the side opposite the sun. These shadows are less distinct at short wavelengths (violet filter) and more distinct at long wavelengths (orange filter). This can be understood if the underlying cloud deck on which the shadow is cast is at a relatively great depth, in which case scattering by molecules in the overlying atmosphere will diffuse light into the shadow. Because molecules scatter blue light much more efficiently than red light, the shadows will be darkest at the longest (reddest) wavelengths, and will appear blue under white light illumination. The resolution of this image is 11 kilometers (6.8 miles per pixel) and the range is only 157,000 kilometers (98,000 miles). The width of the cloud streaks range from 50 to 200 kilometers (31 to 124 miles), and their shadow widths range from 30 to 50 kilometers (18 to 31 miles). Cloud heights appear to be of the order of 50 kilometers (31 miles). This corresponds to 2 scale heights.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00058.jpg,1996-01-29
Neptune’s Dark Spot (D2) at High Resolution,"This bulls-eye view of Neptune's small dark spot (D2) was obtained by Voyager 2's narrow-angle camera on Aug. 24, 1989, when Voyager 2 was within 1.1 million km (680,000 miles) of the planet. The smallest structures that can be seen are 20 km (12 miles) across. This unplanned photograph was obtained when the infrared spectrograph was mapping the planet, and is the highest resolution view of the feature taken during the flyby. Banding surrounding the feature indicates unseen strong winds, while structures within the bright spot suggest both active upwelling of clouds and rotation about the center. A rotation rate has not yet been measured, but the V-shaped structure near the right edge of the bright area indicates that the spot rotates clockwise. Unlike the Great Red Spot on Jupiter, which rotates counterclockwise, if the D2 spot on Neptune rotates clockwise, the material will be descending in the dark oval region. The fact that infrared data will yield temperature information about the region above the clouds makes this observation especially valuable.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00064.jpg,1989-08-24
Triton High Resolution View of Northern Hemisphere,"This is one of the most detailed views of the surface of Triton taken by Voyager 2 on its flyby of the large satellite of Neptune early in the morning of Aug. 25, 1989. The picture was stored on the tape recorder and relayed to Earth later. Taken from a distance of only 40,000 km (25,000 miles), the frame is about 220 kilometers (140 miles) across and shows details as small as 750 meters (0.5 miles). Most of the area is covered by a peculiar landscape of roughly circular depressions separated by rugged ridges. This type of terrain, which covers large tracts of Triton's northern hemisphere, is unlike anything seen elsewhere in the solar system. The depressions are probably not impact craters: They are too similar in size and too regularly spaced. Their origin is still unknown, but may involve local melting and collapse of the icy surface. A conspicuous set of grooves and ridges cuts across the landscape, indicating fracturing and deformation of Triton's surface. The rarity of impact craters suggests a young surface by solar system standards, probably less than a few billion years old.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00061.jpg,1989-08-25
1989N1 Surface Detail,"This image of Neptune's satellite 1989N1 was obtained on Aug. 25, 1989 from a range of 146,000 kilometers (91,000 miles). The resolution is about 2.7 kilometers (1.7 miles) per line pair. The satellite, seen here about half illuminated, has an average radius of some 200 kilometers (120 miles). It is dark (albedo 6 percent) and spectrally grey. Hints of crater-like forms and groove-like lineations can be discerned. The apparent graininess of the image is caused by the short exposure necessary to avoid significant smear.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00062.jpg,1989-08-25
Neptune - True Color of Clouds,"This image of Neptune was taken by Voyager 2's wide-angle camera when the spacecraft was 590,000 km (370,000 miles) from the planet. The image has been processed to obtain true color balance. Additional processing was used to suppress surface brightness of the white clouds. The processing allows both the clouds' structure in the dark regions near the pole and the bright clouds east of the Great Dark Spot to be reproduced in this color photograph. Small trails of similar clouds trending east to west and large scale structure east of the Great Dark Spot all suggest that waves are present in the atmosphere and play a large role in the type of clouds that are visible.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00063.jpg,1996-01-29
Uranus - Final Image,"This view of Uranus was recorded by Voyager 2 on Jan 25, 1986, as the spacecraft left the planet behind and set forth on the cruise to Neptune Voyager was 1 million kilometers (about 600,000 miles) from Uranus when it acquired this wide-angle view. The picture -- a color composite of blue, green and orange frames -- has a resolution of 140 km (90 mi). The thin crescent of Uranus is seen here at an angle of 153 degrees between the spacecraft, the planet and the Sun. Even at this extreme angle, Uranus retains the pale blue-green color seen by ground-based astronomers and recorded by Voyager during its historic encounter. This color results from the presence of methane in Uranus' atmosphere; the gas absorbs red wavelengths of light, leaving the predominant hue seen here. The tendency for the crescent to become white at the extreme edge is caused by the presence of a high-altitude haze Voyager 2 -- having encountered Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986 -- will proceed on its journey to Neptune. Closest approach is scheduled for Aug 24, 1989.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00143.jpg,1986-01-25
Uranus in True and False Color,"These two pictures of Uranus -- one in true color (left) and the other in false color -- were compiled from images returned Jan. 17, 1986, by the narrow-angle camera of Voyager 2. The spacecraft was 9.1 million kilometers (5.7 million miles) from the planet, several days from closest approach. The picture at left has been processed to show Uranus as human eyes would see it from the vantage point of the spacecraft. The picture is a composite of images taken through blue, green and orange filters. The darker shadings at the upper right of the disk correspond to the day-night boundary on the planet. Beyond this boundary lies the hidden northern hemisphere of Uranus, which currently remains in total darkness as the planet rotates. The blue-green color results from the absorption of red light by methane gas in Uranus' deep, cold and remarkably clear atmosphere. The picture at right uses false color and extreme contrast enhancement to bring out subtle details in the polar region of Uranus. Images obtained through ultraviolet, violet and orange filters were respectively converted to the same blue, green and red colors used to produce the picture at left. The very slight contrasts visible in true color are greatly exaggerated here. In this false-color picture, Uranus reveals a dark polar hood surrounded by a series of progressively lighter concentric bands. One possible explanation is that a brownish haze or smog, concentrated over the pole, is arranged into bands by zonal motions of the upper atmosphere. The bright orange and yellow strip at the lower edge of the planet's limb is an artifact of the image enhancement. In fact, the limb is dark and uniform in color around the planet.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00032.jpg,1986-01-17
Miranda - High Resolution Mosaic,"This computer-assembled mosaic of Miranda includes many of the high-resolution frames obtained by Voyager 2 during its close flyby of the Uranian moon. Miranda, roughly 500 kilometers (300 miles) in diameter, exhibits varied geologic provinces, seen in this mosaic of clear-filter, narrow-angle images from Jan. 24, 1986. The images were obtained from distances of 30,160 to 40,310 km (18,730 to 25,030 mi); resolution ranges from 560 to 740 meters (1,840 to 2,430 feet). These are among the highest-resolution pictures that Voyager has obtained of any of the new ""worlds"" it has encountered during its mission. On Miranda, ridges and valleys of one province are cut off against the boundary of the next province. Probable compressional (pushed-together) folded ridges are seen in curvilinear patterns, as are many extensional (pulled-apart) faults. Some of these show very large scarps, or cliffs, ranging from O.5 to 5 km (O.3 to 3 mi) in height -- that is, higher that the walls of the Grand Canyon on Earth. The missing piece of Miranda's surface will be included in a later mosaic once more complicated computer processing can be completed.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00043.jpg,1986-01-24
Europa - Mosaic,"Europa looks like a cracked egg in this computer mosaic of the best Voyager 2 images. In this presentation, the variation of surface brightness due to the angle of the sun has been removed by computer processing, so that surface features can be seen equally well at all places. The many broad dark streaks show up well, but this presentation does not bring out the much fainter and more enigmatic light streaks. These pictures were taken from a distance of about 250,000 kilometers and show features as small as 5 kilometers across.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00366.jpg,1996-08-09
Jupiter’s North Equatorial Belt,"This image returned by Voyager 2 shows one of the long dark clouds observed in the North Equatorial Belt of Jupiter. A high, white cloud is seen moving over the darker cloud, providing an indication of the structure of the cloud layers. Thin white clouds are also seen within the dark cloud.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00458.jpg,1996-09-26
Callisto False Color,"This false color picture of Callisto was taken by Voyager 2 on July 7, 1979 at a range of 1,094,666 kilometers (677,000 miles) and is centered on 11 degrees N and 171 degrees W. This rendition uses an ultraviolet image for the blue component. Because the surface displays regional contrast in UV, variations in surface materials are apparent. Notice in particular the dark blue haloes which surround bright craters in the eastern hemisphere. The surface of Callisto is the most heavily cratered of the Galilean satellites and resembles ancient heavily cratered terrains on the moon, Mercury and Mars. The bright areas are ejecta thrown out by relatively young impact craters. A large ringed structure, probably an impact basin, is shown in the upper left part of the picture. The color version of this picture was constructed by compositing black and white images taken through the ultraviolet, clear and orange filters.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00457.jpg,1979-07-07
Jupiter’s Great Red Spot and South Equatorial Belt,This Voyager 2 picture shows the Great Red Spot and the south equatorial belt extending into the equatorial region. At right is an interchange of material between the south equatorial belt and the equatorial zone. The clouds in the equatorial zone are more diffuse and do not display the structures seen in other locations. Considerable structure is evident within the Great Red Spot.,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00456.jpg,1996-09-26
Triton - Detail of Dark and Light Material,"Voyager 2 acquired this black and white image of Triton, Neptune's largest satellite, during the night of Aug. 24-25, 1989. Triton's limb cuts obliquely across the middle of the image. The field of view is about 1,000 km (600 miles) across. Three irregular dark areas, surrounded by brighter material, dominate the image. Low-lying material with intermediate albedo occupies the central area, and fresh craters occur along the right margin. Sub-parallel alignment of linear patches of dark material shown in the lower and left part of the image suggests that the patches are structurally controlled.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00056.jpg,1996-09-26
Triton South Polar Terrain,"This image of the south polar terrain of Triton, taken on Aug. 25, 1989 reveals about 50 dark plumes or 'wind streaks' on the icy surface. The plumes originate at very dark spots generally a few miles in diameter and some are more than 100 miles long. The spots which clearly mark the source of the dark material may be vents where gas has erupted from beneath the surface and carried dark particles into Triton's nitrogen atmosphere. Southwesterly winds then transported the erupted particles, which formed gradually thinning deposits to the northeast of most vents. It is possible that the eruptions have been driven by seasonal heating of very shallow subsurface deposits of volatiles, and the winds transporting particles similarly may be seasonal winds. The polar terrain, upon which the dark streaks have been deposited, is a region of bright materials mottled with irregular, somewhat dark patches. The pattern of irregular patches suggests that they may correspond to lag deposits of moderately dark material that cap the bright ice over the polar terrain.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00059.jpg,1989-08-25
Europa During Voyager 2 Closest Approach,"This color image of the Jovian moon Europa was acquired by Voyager 2 during its close encounter on Monday morning, July 9, 1979. Europa, the size of our moon, is thought to have a crust of ice perhaps 100 kilometers thick which overlies the silicate crust. The complex array of streaks indicate that the crust has been fractured and filled by materials from the interior. The lack of relief, any visible mountains or craters, on its bright limb is consistent with a thick ice crust. In contrast to its icy neighbors, Ganymede and Callisto, Europa has very few impact craters. One possible candidate is the small feature near the center of this image with radiating rays and a bright circular interior. The relative absence of features and low topography suggests the crust is young and warm a few kilometers below the surface. The tidal heating process suggested for Io also may be heating Europa's interior at a lower rate.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00459.jpg,1979-07-09
Jupiter’s Great Red Spot Region,"This mosaic of the Great Red Spot shows that the region has changed significantly since the Voyager 1 encounter three months ago. Around the northern boundary a white cloud is seen, which extends to east of the region. The presence of this cloud prevents small cloud vertices from circling the spot in the manner seen in the Voyager 1 encounter. Another white oval cloud (different from the one present in this position three months ago) is seen south of the Great Red Spot. The internal structure of these spots is identical. Since they both rotate in an anticyclonic manner these observations indicate that they are meteorologically similar. This image was taken on July 6 from a range of 2,633,003 kilometers.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00065.jpg,1996-09-26
Triton - False Color of ‘Cantaloupe’ Terrain,"Voyager violet, green, and ultraviolet images of Triton were map projected into cylindrical coordinates and combined to produce this false color terrain map. Several compositionally distinct terrain and geologic features are portrayed. At center is a gray blue unit referred to as 'cantaloupe' terrain because of its unusual topographic texture. The unit appears to predate other units to the left. Immediately adjacent to the cantaloupe terrain, is a smoother unit, represented by a reddish color, that has been dissected by a prominent fault system. This unit apparently overlies a much higher albedo material, seen farther left. A prominent angular albedo boundary separates relatively undisturbed smooth terrain from irregular patches which have been derived from breakup of the same material. Also visible at the far left are diffuse, elongated streaks, which seem to emanate from circular, often bright centered features. The parallel streaks may represent vented particulate materials blown in the same direction by winds in Triton's thin atmosphere.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00060.jpg,1996-09-26
Uranus Cloud Movement,"Time-lapse Voyager 2 images of Uranus show the movement of two small, bright, streaky clouds -- the first such features ever seen on the planet. The clouds were detected in this series of orange-filtered images taken Jan. 14, 1986, over a 4.6-hour interval (from top to bottom). At the time, the spacecraft was about 12.9 million kilometers (8.0 million miles) from the planet, whose pole of rotation is near the center of each disk. Uranus, which is tipped on its side with respect to the other planets, is rotating in a counterclockwise direction, as are the two clouds seen here as bright streaks. (The occasional donut-shaped features that show up are shadows cast by dust in the camera optics. The processing necessary to bring out the faint features on the planet also brings out these camera blemishes.) The larger of the two clouds is at a latitude of 33 degrees; the smaller cloud, seen faintly in the three lower images, lies at 26 degrees (a lower latitude and hence closer to the limb). Their counterclockwise periods of rotation are 16.2 and 16.9 hours, respectively. This difference implies that the lower-latitude feature is lagging behind the higher-latitude feature at a speed of almost 100 meters per second (220 mph). Latitudinal bands are also visible in these images. The faint bands, more numerous now than in previous Voyager images from longer range, are concentric with the pole of rotation -- that is, they circle the planet in lines of constant latitude.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00369.jpg,1986-01-14
Uranus - Discrete Cloud,"This false-color Voyager picture of Uranus shows a discrete cloud seen as a bright streak near the planet's limb. The picture is a highly processed composite of three images obtained Jan. 14, 1986, when the spacecraft was 12.9 million kilometers (8.0 million miles) from the planet. The cloud visible here is the most prominent feature seen in a series of Voyager images designed to track atmospheric motions. (The occasional donut-shaped features, including one at the bottom, are shadows cast by dust in the camera optics; the processing necessary to bring out the faint features on the planet also brings out these camera blemishes.) Three separate images were shuttered through violet, blue and orange filters. Each color image showed the cloud to a different degree; because they were not exposed at exactly the same time, the images were processed to provide a correction for a good spatial match. In a true-color image, the cloud would be barely discernible; the false color helps bring out additional details. The different colors imply variations in vertical structure, but as yet is not possible to be specific about such differences. One possibility is that the Uranian atmosphere contains smog-like constituents, in which case some color differences may represent differences in how these molecules are distributed.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00370.jpg,1986-01-14
Jupiter - Io In Front of Jupiter’s Turbulent Clouds,"This photograph of the southern hemisphere of Jupiter was obtained by Voyager 2 on June 25, 1979, at a distance of 12 million kilometers (8 million miles). The Voyager spacecraft is rapidly nearing the giant planet, with closest approach to occur at 4:23 pm PDT on July 9. Seen in front of the turbulent clouds of the planet is Io, the innermost of the large Galilean satellites of Jupiter. Io is the size of our moon. Voyager discovered in early March that Io is the most volcanically active planetary body known in the solar system, with continuous eruptions much larger than any that take place on the Earth. The red, orange, and yellow colors of Io are thought to be deposits of sulfur and sulfur compounds produced in these eruptions. The smallest features in either Jupiter or Io that can be distinguished in this picture are about 200 kilometers (125 miles) across; this resolution, it is not yet possible to identify individual volcanic eruptions. Monitoring of the erupture activity of Io by Voyager 2 will begin about July 5 and will extend past the encounter July 9.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00371.jpg,1979-06-25
Jupiter - Region from the Great Red Spot to the South Pole,"This picture shows a region of the southern hemisphere extending from the Great Red Spot to the south pole. The white oval is seen beneath the Great Red Spot, and several small scale spots are visible farther to the south. Some of these organized cloud spots have similar morphologies, such as anticyclonic rotations and cyclonic regions to their west. The presence of the white oval causes the streamlines of the flow to bunch up between it and the Great Red Spot.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00372.jpg,1996-11-13
Uranus Satellites,"Three of the newly discovered satellites of Uranus are captured in this Voyager 2 image taken Jan. 18, 1986, when the spacecraft was 7.7 million kilometers (4.8 million miles) from the planet. All three lie outside the orbits of Uranus nine known rings, the outermost of which, the epsilon ring, is seen at upper right. The largest of the three moons viewed here, 1986U1, was discovered Jan. 3; it is an estimated 90 km (55 mi) across and orbits Uranus once every 12 hours 19 minutes at a distance of 66,090 km (41,040 mi) from the planet's center. The other two moons are slightly smaller. 1986U3 orbits once every 11 hours 6 minutes at 61,750 km (38,350 mi), 1986U4 every 13 hours 24 minutes at 69,920 km (43,420 mi). They were discovered on Jan. 9 and 13, respectively. Long exposures were required to bring out these small objects; thus, as a result of the relative motions of the spacecraft and the moons, they appear slightly elongated.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00368.jpg,1986-01-18
Rings of Jupiter,"The rings of Jupiter proved to be unexpectedly bright when seen with the Sun nearly behind them. Strong forward scattering of sunlight is characteristic of small particles. This view was obtained by Voyager 2 on July 10 from a perspective inside the shadow of Jupiter. The distance of the spacecraft from the rings was about 1.5 million kilometers. Although the resolution has been degraded by camera motion during the time exposures, these images reveal the rings have some radial structure.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00377.jpg,1997-01-09
Rings of Jupiter Star Trail,"The rings of Jupiter proved to be unexpectedly bright when seen with the Sun nearly behind them.

Wide-Angle Image of Saturn’s Rings,"This wide-angle image of Saturn's rings was taken Aug. 26 just before Voyager 2's crossing of the plane of these complex structures. The spacecraft was 103,000 kilometers (64,000 miles) from the rings when it acquired this image. This extremely oblique view of the bright side of the rings highly magnifies features near the bottom of the picture and compresses features across to the other side of the west ansa (the western edge of the loop in the rings). Starting from the bottom, one can see the F-ring, the A-ring with the Encke Gap, the Cassini Division (the narrow dark band at center), the B-ring and the C-ring. The high-contrast bright and dark areas of the C-ring are seen at right; then, continuing upward, come the B- and A-rings straddling the Cassini Division and a very foreshortened view of the A-ring. The bright streaks in the B-ring are the spokes in forward-scattered light.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00534.jpg,1997-05-24
Neptune Scooter,"This photograph of Neptune was reconstructed from two images taken by Voyager 2's narrow-angle camera, through the green and clear filters. The image shows three of the features that Voyager 2 has been photographing during recent weeks. At the north (top) is the Great Dark Spot, accompanied by bright, white clouds that undergo rapid changes in appearance. To the south of the Great Dark Spot is the bright feature that Voyager scientists have nicknamed ""Scooter."" Still farther south is the feature called ""Dark Spot 2,"" which has a bright core. Each feature moves eastward at a different velocity, so it is only occasionally that they appear close to each other, such as at the time this picture was taken.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01142.jpg,1998-01-08

Triton’s Southern Hemisphere,"This polar projection of Triton's southern hemisphere provides a view of the southern polar cap and bright equatorial fringe. The margin of the cap is scalloped and ranges in latitude from +10 degrees to -30 degrees. The bright fringe is closely associated with the cap's margin; from it, diffuse bright rays extend north-northeast for hundreds of kilometers. The bright fringe probably consists of very fresh nitrogen frost or snow, and the rays consist of bright-fringe materials that were redistributed by north-moving Coriolis-deflected winds.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00423.jpg,1998-06-08
Europa Crescent,"This mosaic of Europa, the smallest Galilean satellite, was taken by Voyager 2. This face of Europa is centered at about the 300 degree meridian. The bright areas are probably ice deposits, whereas the darkened areas may be the rocky surface or areas with a more patchy distribution of ice. The most unusual features are the systems of long linear structures that cross the surface in various directions. Some of these linear structures are over 1,000 kilometers long and about 2 or 3 kilometers wide. They may be fractures or faults which have disrupted the surface.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00325.jpg,1998-06-04
Color Sequence of Triton Approach Images,"Triton Voyager 2 approach sequence with latitude-longitude grid superposed. The color image was reconstructed by making a computer composite of three black and white images taken through red, green, and blue filters. Details on Triton's surface unfold dramatically in this sequence of approach images. South Pole near the bottom of the images at the convergence of lines of longitude. Resolution changes from about 60 km/pixel (37 mi/pixel) in the image at upper left taken from a distance of 500,000 (311,000 mi) to about 5 km/pixel (3.1 mi/pixel) for the image at lower right. Global and regional albedo features are visible in all of the images. The albedo features can be tracked in successive images and show that Triton has undergone about 3/4 of a rotation during the 4.3-day interval over which these images were obtained. A southern polar cap of bright pink, yellow, and white materials covers nearly all of the southern hemisphere; these materials consist of nitrogen ice with traces of other substances, including frozen methane and carbon monoxide. Feeble ultraviolet radiation from the sun is thought to act on methane to cause chemical reactions to the pinkish yellowish substances. At the time of the Voyager 2 flyby (Aug. 1989) Triton's southern hemisphere was starting the summer season and the South Pole was canted toward the sun day and night, such that the polar cap was sublimating under the relatively 'hot' summer sun (surface temperature about 38 K, about -391 degree F). Numerous dark streaks on the southern polar nitrogen-ice cap are thought to consist of dark dust deposited by prevailing winds in Triton's tenuous nitrogen atmosphere. A bluish band, seen in all of the images, nearly circumstances Triton's equator; this band is thought to consist of fairly nitrogen frost, perhaps deposited in the decade prior to Voyager 2's flyby.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00329.jpg,1998-06-04
Crater Rays on Ganymede,"This mosaic of Voyager 2 images taken July 9, 1979, shows a prominent rayed crater on Jupiter's icy moon, Ganymede. The view on the left is a monochrome image, and that on the right is the same scene shown in false color designed to accentuate the icy ejecta rays splashed out by the impact. This crater is about 150 km (93 miles) across. Like several other large craters in this scene, the rayed one has a central pit, whose origins remain speculative but may involve impact melting or solid-state fluidization of the icy crust. Bright crater rays on Ganymede, like those on our own Moon, are useful to geologists because they constitute a set of features that were laid across the moon's surface at a discrete point in time--thus they serve as time markers that can be used to establish the sequence of events that shaped Ganymede's surface. For instance, the crater rays appear to be painted over, hence are younger than, areas of grooved terrain (lower left quadrant), whereas a somewhat smaller crater at the center of the scene has icy ejecta that appears to bury (hence, post-dates) the large crater ray system. One can conclude that the grooved terrain formed first, then the large crater and its rays, and then the smaller crater and its fresh icy ejecta deposits.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00334.jpg,1979-07-09
Neptune on Triton’s Horizon,"Composite view showing Neptune on Triton's horizon. Neptune's south pole is to the left; clearly visible in the planets' southern hemisphere is a Great Dark Spot, a large anticyclonic storm system located about 20 degrees South. The foreground is a computer generated view of Triton's maria as they would appear from a point approximately 45 km above the surface. The terraces visible in this image indicate multiple episodes of 'cryovolcanic' flooding. This three-dimensional view was created from a Voyager image by using a two-dimensional photoclinometric model. Relief has been exaggerated roughly 30-fold, the actual range of the relief is about 1 km. Would Neptune appear to be rising or setting? Neither, due to the motion of Triton relative to Neptune, it would appear to move laterally along the horizon, eventually rising and setting at high latitudes.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00344.jpg,1998-06-04
Global Color Mosaic of Triton,"Global color mosaic of Triton, taken in 1989 by Voyager 2 during its flyby of the Neptune system. Color was synthesized by combining high-resolution images taken through orange, violet, and ultraviolet filters; these images were displayed as red, green, and blue images and combined to create this color version. With a radius of 1,350 (839 mi), about 22% smaller than Earth's moon, Triton is by far the largest satellite of Neptune. It is one of only three objects in the Solar System known to have a nitrogen-dominated atmosphere (the others are Earth and Saturn's giant moon, Titan). Triton has the coldest surface known anywhere in the Solar System (38 K, about -391 degrees Fahrenheit); it is so cold that most of Triton's nitrogen is condensed as frost, making it the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a surface made mainly of nitrogen ice. The pinkish deposits constitute a vast south polar cap believed to contain methane ice, which would have reacted under sunlight to form pink or red compounds. The dark streaks overlying these pink ices are believed to be an icy and perhaps carbonaceous dust deposited from huge geyser-like plumes, some of which were found to be active during the Voyager 2 flyby. The bluish-green band visible in this image extends all the way around Triton near the equator; it may consist of relatively fresh nitrogen frost deposits. The greenish areas includes what is called the cantaloupe terrain, whose origin is unknown, and a set of ""cryovolcanic"" landscapes apparently produced by icy-cold liquids (now frozen) erupted from Triton's interior.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00317.jpg,1998-06-04
Montage of Neptune and Triton,"This computer generated montage shows Neptune as it would appear from a spacecraft approaching Triton, Neptune's largest moon at 2706 km (1683 mi) in diameter. The wind and sublimation-eroded south polar cap of Triton is shown at the bottom of the Triton image, a cryovolcanic terrain at the upper right, and the enigmatic ""cantaloupe terrain"" at the upper left. Triton's surface is mostly covered by nitrogen frost mixed with traces of condensed methane, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide. The tenuous atmosphere of Triton, though only about one-hundredth of one percent of Earth's atmospheric density at the surface, is thick enough to produce wind-deposited streaks of dark and bright materials of unknown composition in the south polar cap region. The southern polar cap was sublimating at the time of the Voyager 2 flyby, as indicated by the irregular and eroded appearance of the edge of the cap. The polar frosts were sublimating because Triton's orbital and rotational motion causes the sun to shine directly on the polar cap for a period of several decades during Neptune's and Triton's long austral summer. Though the polar cap was undergoing ""heat death,"" surface temperatures still were only about 38 K (-391 degrees Fahrenheit).",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00340.jpg,1998-06-04
Jupiter,"This processed color image of Jupiter was produced in 1990 by the U.S. Geological Survey from a Voyager image captured in 1979. The colors have been enhanced to bring out detail. Zones of light-colored, ascending clouds alternate with bands of dark, descending clouds. The clouds travel around the planet in alternating eastward and westward belts at speeds of up to 540 kilometers per hour. Tremendous storms as big as Earthly continents surge around the planet. The Great Red Spot (oval shape toward the lower-left) is an enormous anticyclonic storm that drifts along its belt, eventually circling the entire planet.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00343.jpg,1998-06-04
"Voyager 2 Color Image of Enceladus, Almost Full Disk","This color Voyager 2 image mosaic shows the water-ice-covered surface of Enceladus, one of Saturn's icy moons. Enceladus' diameter of just 500 km would fit across the state of Arizona, yet despite its small size Enceladus exhibits one of the most interesting surfaces of all the icy satellites. Enceladus reflects about 90% of the incident sunlight (about like fresh-fallen snow), placing it among the most reflective objects in the Solar System. Several geologic terrains have superposed crater densities that span a factor of at least 500, thereby indicating huge differences in the ages of these terrains. It is possible that the high reflectivity of Enceladus' surface results from continuous deposition of icy particles from Saturn's E-ring, which in fact may originate from icy volcanoes on Enceladus' surface. Some terrains are dominated by sinuous mountain ridges from 1 to 2 km high (3300 to 6600 feet), whereas other terrains are scarred by linear cracks, some of which show evidence for possible sideways fault motion such as that of California's infamous San Andreas fault. Some terrains appear to have formed by separation of icy plates along cracks, and other terrains are exceedingly smooth at the resolution of this image. The implication carried by Enceladus' surface is that this tiny ice ball has been geologically active and perhaps partially liquid in its interior for much of its history. The heat engine that powers geologic activity here is thought to be elastic deformation caused by tides induced by Enceladus' orbital motion around Saturn and the motion of another moon, Dione.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00347.jpg,1998-06-04
Color Voyager 2 Image Showing Crescent Uranus,"This image shows a crescent Uranus, a view that Earthlings never witnessed until Voyager 2 flew near and then beyond Uranus on January 24, 1986. This planet's natural blue-green color is due to the absorption of redder wavelengths in the atmosphere by traces of methane gas. Uranus' diameter is 32,500 miles, a little over four times that of Earth. The hazy blue-green atmosphere probably extends to a depth of around 5,400 miles, where it rests above what is believed to be an icy or liquid mixture (an 'ocean') of water, ammonia, methane, and other volatiles, which in turn surrounds a rocky core perhaps a little smaller than Earth.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00346.jpg,1986-01-24
"Saturn and 4 Icy Moons, Enhanced Color","This enhanced-color picture shows Saturn, its rings, and four of its icy satellites. Three satellites (Tethys, Dione, and Rhea) are visible against the darkness of space, and another smaller satellite (Mimas) is visible against Saturn's cloud tops very near the left horizon and just below the rings. The dark shadows of Mimas and Tethys are also visible on Saturn's cloud tops, and the shadow of Saturn is seen across part of the rings. Saturn, second in size only to Jupiter in our Solar System, is 120,660 km (75,000 mi) in diameter at its equator (the ring plane) but, because of its rapid spin, Saturn is 10% smaller measured through its poles. Saturn's rings are composed mostly of ice particles ranging from microscopic dust to boulders in size. These particles orbit Saturn in a vast disk that is a mere 100 meters (330 feet) or so thick. The rings' thinness contrasts with their huge diameter--for instance 272,400 km (169,000 mi) for the outer part of the bright A ring, the outermost ring visible here. The pronounced concentric gap in the rings, the Cassini Division (named after its discoverer), is a 3500-km wide region (2200 mi, almost the width of the United States) that is much less populated with ring particles than the brighter B and A rings to either side of the gap. The rings also show some enigmatic radial structure ('spokes'), particularly at left. This image was synthesized from images taken in Voyager's orange, blue, and ultraviolet filters and was processed to create an exaggerated false color.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00349.jpg,1998-06-04
Iapetus Bright and Dark Terrains,"Saturn's outermost large moon, Iapetus, has a bright, heavily cratered icy terrain and a dark terrain, as shown in this Voyager 2 image taken on August 22, 1981. Amazingly, the dark material covers precisely the side of Iapetus that leads in the direction of orbital motion around Saturn (except for the poles), whereas the bright material occurs on the trailing hemisphere and at the poles. The bright terrain is made of dirty ice, and the dark terrain is surfaced by carbonaceous molecules, according to measurements made with Earth-based telescopes. Iapetus' dark hemisphere has been likened to tar or asphalt and is so dark that no details within this terrain were visible to Voyager 2. The bright icy hemisphere, likened to dirty snow, shows many large impact craters. The closest approach by Voyager 2 to Iapetus was a relatively distant 600,000 miles, so that our best images, such as this, have a resolution of about 12 miles. The dark material is made of organic substances, probably including poisonous cyano compounds such as frozen hydrogen cyanide polymers. Though we know a little about the dark terrain's chemical nature, we do not understand its origin. Two theories have been developed, but neither is fully satisfactory--(1) the dark material may be organic dust knocked off the small neighboring satellite Phoebe and ""painted"" onto the leading side of Iapetus as the dust spirals toward Saturn and Iapetus hurtles through the tenuous dust cloud, or (2) the dark material may be made of icy-cold carbonaceous ""cryovolcanic"" lavas that were erupted from Iapetus' interior and then blackened by solar radiation, charged particles, and cosmic rays. A determination of the actual cause, as well as discovery of any other geologic features smaller than 12 miles across, awaits the Cassini Saturn orbiter to arrive in 2004.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00348.jpg,1981-08-22
Saturn and 4 Icy Moons in Natural Color,"This approximate natural-color image shows Saturn, its rings, and four of its icy satellites.

Saturn With Rhea and Dione (false color),"NASA's Voyager 2 took this 'false color' photograph of Saturn on July 21, 1981, when the spacecraft was 33.9 million kilometers (21 million miles) from the planet. Two bright, presumably convective cloud patterns are visible in the mid-northern hemisphere and several dark spoke-like features can be seen in the broad B-ring (left of planet). The moons Rhea and Dione appear as blue dots to the south and southeast of Saturn, respectively. Voyager 2 made its closest approach to Saturn on Aug. 25, 1981.

Neptune Full Disk View,"This picture of Neptune was produced from the last whole planet images taken through the green and orange filters on the Voyager 2 narrow angle camera. The images were taken at a range of 4.4 million miles from the planet, 4 days and 20 hours before closest approach. The picture shows the Great Dark Spot and its companion bright smudge; on the west limb the fast moving bright feature called Scooter and the little dark spot are visible. These clouds were seen to persist for as long as Voyager's cameras could resolve them. North of these, a bright cloud band similar to the south polar streak may be seen.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01492.jpg,1998-10-30

South Polar View of Miranda,"Uranus' moon Miranda is shown in a computer-assembled mosaic of images obtained Jan. 24, 1986, by the Voyager 2 spacecraft. Miranda is the innermost and smallest of the five major Uranian satellites, just 480 kilometers (about 300 miles) in diameter. Nine images were combined to obtain this full-disc, south-polar view, which shows the varying geologic provinces of Miranda. The bulk of the photo comprises seven high-resolution images from the Voyager closest-approach sequence. Data from more distant, lower-resolution images were used to fill in gaps along the limb.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01490.jpg,1986-01-24
Neptune and Triton,"This image was returned by the Voyager 2 spacecraft on July 3, 1989, when it was 76 million kilometers (47 million miles) from Neptune. The planet and its largest satellite, Triton, are captured in the field of view of Voyager's narrow-angle camera through violet, clear and orange filters. Triton appears in the lower right corner at about 5 o'clock relative to Neptune. Recent measurements from Voyager images show Triton to be between 1,400 and 1,800 kilometers (about 870 to 1,100 miles) in radius with a surface that is about as bright as freshly fallen snow. Because Triton is barely resolved in current narrow-angle images, it is too early to see features on its surface. Scientists believe Triton has at least a small atmosphere of methane and possibly other gases.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01491.jpg,1989-07-03

Composition Differences within Saturn’s Rings,"Possible variations in chemical composition from one part of Saturn's ring system to another are visible in this Voyager 2 picture as subtle color variations that can be recorded with special computer-processing techniques. This highly enhanced color view was assembled from clear, orange and ultraviolet frames obtained Aug. 17, 1981, from a distance of 8.9 million kilometers (5.5 million miles). In addition to the previously known blue color of the C-ring and the Cassini Division, the picture shows additional color differences between the inner B-ring and outer region (where the spokes form) and between these and the A-ring.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01486.jpg,1981-08-17
Uranus’ Largest Moon Oberon,"Uranus' outermost and largest moon, Oberon, is seen in this Voyager 2 image, obtained Jan. 22, 1986, from a distance of 2.77 million kilometers (1.72 million miles). The clear-filter image, shuttered by Voyager's narrow-angle camera, shows that Oberon displays several distinct highly reflective (high-albedo) patches with low-albedo centers. Some of the bright patches are suggestive of radial patterns that could represent impact craters excavated from an icy surface. On average, Oberon reflects about 20 percent of the incident sunlight. The moon is about 1,600 km (1,000 mi) in diameter; resolution of this image is 51 km (32 mi). It was taken two days before Voyager's closest approach to Oberon, at which point the spacecraft will be about 471,000 km (293,000 mi) away.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01352.jpg,1986-01-22
Saturnian Atmospheric Storm,"A vortex, or large atmospheric storm, is visible at 74` north latitude in this color composite of Voyager 2 Saturn images obtained Aug. 25, 1979 from a range of 1 million kilometers (620,000 miles). Three wide-angle-camera images taken through green, orange and blue filters were used. This particular storm system seems to be one of the few large-scale structures in Saturn's polar region, which otherwise is dominated by much smaller-scale features suggesting convection. The darker, bluish structure (upper right) oriented east to west strongly suggests the presence of a jet stream at these high latitudes. The appearance of a strong east-west flow in the polar-region could have a major influence on models of Saturn's atmospheric circulation, if the existence of such a flow can be substantiated in time sequences of Voyager images. The smallest features visible in this photograph are about 20 km. (12 mi.) across.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01379.jpg,1979-08-25
Photographic Mosaic of Saturn,"This photographic mosaic of Saturn is the result of the processing of three green-filter frames obtained Aug. 20, when Voyager 2 was 5.7 million kilometers (3.4 million miles) from the planet. At this resolution, the smallest visible features are 100 km. (60 mi.) across. This photograph illustrates the type of processing that can be used to obtain data concerning wind speeds and the evolution of individual cloud pairs. For these purposes, selected sets of data spanning known time intervals are used. Because the image processors are not enhancing three colors equally to compose a single color image, they are free to stretch and filter the data to maximize the visible structure of the color that shows the greatest contrast.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01377.jpg,1998-11-13
Voyager 2 Image of Saturn,"This Voyager 2 image of Saturn, obtained Aug. 21 from a distance of 5.4 million kilometers (3.4 million miles), shows further evidence of weather patterns at all latitudes. A stream of clouds is moving in the westward flow at about 15 meters-per-second (33 mph). The clouds are attached to a large spot about 3,000 km. (1,900 mi.) in diameter; the spot moves eastward at about 30 meters-per-second (65 mph) and shows the anti-cyclonic rotation of the combined features. Another spot is seen to the east of the larger cloud, with a similar anti-cyclonic rotation. This ribbonlike feature seen in the latitude band centered at 47 north marks a high-speed jet of about 150 meters-per-second (330 mph). Further small-scale clouds are evident toward the polar region (upper right).",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01376.jpg,1998-11-13

Saturn’s Ribbonlike Cloud Structure,"The extensive ribbonlike cloud structure in Saturn's atmosphere is visible in this Voyager 2 green-filter photograph, obtained Aug. 23 from a range of 2.5 million kilometers (1.6 million miles). Some Voyager scientists have interpreted the ribbon to be a large-scale atmospheric wave; it is believed to lie in a rapid eastward-moving jet stream. The presence of vortices adjacent to the ribbon itself will help scientists understand the relationship between such structures and the strong jet-streams present in Saturn's atmosphere. The smallest features visible in this photograph measure about 50 km. (30 mi.) across.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01378.jpg,2012-06-25
Rings of Uranus at 1.44 kilometers,"The outer rings of Uranus are visible in this Voyager 2 image, obtained Jan. 23, 1986, from a distance of 1.44 million kilometers (890,000 miles). The outermost and brightest ring, called epsilon, is visible along with the fainter and narrower delta and gamma rings (from left). This clear-filter, 15-second exposure was shuttered by Voyager's narrow-angle camera. The resolution of this image is about 15 km (9 mi). The epsilon ring is resolved into two bright components separated by a darker lane of material. Voyager scientists believe this is caused by a thinning of the ring material away from the edges of the ring. This image was part of a sequence of pictures designed to search for moons orbiting within the rings and responsible for their narrow appearance. One of two such ""shepherd"" moons discovered by Voyager -- found Jan. 20 and designated 1986U7 -- is visible as the elongated bright feature midway between the epsilon and delta rings. The moon appears elongated because its orbital motion smeared its image during the long exposure.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01350.jpg,1986-01-23
Outer Part of the Uranian Ring System,"Voyager 2's wide-angle camera captured this view of the outer part of the Uranian ring system the morning of Jan. 24, 1986, just 11 minutes before passing through the ring plane. The spacecraft was 125,000 kilometers (78,000 miles) away when it obtained this clear-filter view; the resolution is slightly better than 9 km (6 mi). The brightest, outermost ring is known as epsilon. Interior to epsilon lie (from top) the newly discovered 10th ring of Uranus -- designated 1986UR1 and barely visible here -- and then the delta, gamma and eta rings.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01355.jpg,1986-01-24
Uranus’ Innermost Satellite Miranda,"Miranda, innermost of Uranus' large satellites, is seen at close range in this Voyager 2 image, taken Jan. 24, 1986, as part of a high-resolution mosaicing sequence. Voyager was some 36,000 kilometers (22,000 miles) away from Miranda. This clear-filter, narrow-angle image shows an area about 250 km (150 mi) across, at a resolution of about 800 meters (2,600 feet). Two distinct terrain types are visible: a rugged, higher-elevation terrain (right) and a lower, striated terrain. Numerous craters on the rugged, higher terrain indicate that it is older than the lower terrain. Several scarps, probably faults, cut the different terrains. The impact crater in the lower part of this image is about 25 km (15 mi) across.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01354.jpg,1986-01-24
A View of Saturn’s F-ring,"Voyager 2 obtained this picture of Saturn's F-ring on Aug. 26 just before the spacecraft crossed the planet's ring plane. This edge-on view, taken from a range of 103,000 kilometers (64,000 miles), shows nearly 25` of the F-ring, with at least four distinct components visible. Voyager's photopolarimeter conducted a higher-resolution scan through another part of the ring, showing it to be composed of even more distinct ringlets than this frame would indicate.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01382.jpg,1998-11-17
A View of Saturn’s B-ring,"This Voyager 2 photograph of the lit face of Saturn's B-ring was obtained Aug. 25 from a distance of 743,000 kilometers (461,000 miles). It covers a range of about 6,000 km. (3,700 mi.) and shows the ring structure broken up into about 10 times more ringlets than previously suspected. The narrowest features here are about 15 km. (10 mi.) wide. Variations in brightness are due to a combination of differences in ring particle number density and light scattering properties. The B-ring is the most opaque of Saturn's rings; the highest-resolution Voyager 1 observations were of its unlit face, where little detail is visible.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01380.jpg,1998-11-17
Thin Ringlet of Saturn’s A-ring,"Voyager 2 discovered a new ""kinky"" ringlet inside the Encke Gap in Saturn's A-ring. These pictures show the thin ringlet at two different positions, photographed Aug. 25 from a distance of about 700,000 kilometers (435,000 miles) near the time the spacecraft crossed the planet's ring plane. Resolution is about 15 km. (9 mi.) in both frames. Here, the ringlet appears in two different positions: about midway in the gap in the right-hand image and near the inner edge of the gap at left. Scientists do not know if the kinky ring is eccentric, or off-center, or if perhaps there are several inner rings, with different components visible at different longitudes. The kinks, clearly visible on the right, appear to be more closely spaced than those seen in Saturn's outer F-ring. (The fine white dots or ""snow"" in these pictures are artifacts of processing and are not individual moonlets).",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01381.jpg,1998-11-17
Ariel’s Transecting Valleys,"This highest-resolution Voyager 2 view of Ariel's terminator shows a complex array of transecting valleys with super-imposed impact craters. Voyager obtained this clear-filter, narrow-angle view from a distance of 130,000 kilometers (80,000 miles) and with a resolution of about 2.4 km (1.5 mi). Particularly striking to Voyager scientists is the fact that the faults that bound the linear valleys are not visible where they transect one another across the valleys. Apparently these valleys were filled with deposits sometime after they were formed by tectonic processes, leaving them flat and smooth. Sinuous rilles (trenches) later formed, probably by some flow process. Some type of fluid flow may well have been involved in their evolution.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01356.jpg,1998-12-05
Jupiter’s Great Red Spot,"This color composite made from Voyager 2 narrow-angle camera frames shows the Great Red Spot during the late Jovian afternoon. North of the Red Spot lies a curious darker section of the South Equatorial Belt (SEB), the belt in which the Red Spot is located. A bright eruption of material passing from the SEB northward into the diffuse equatorial clouds has been observed on all occasions when this feature passes north of the Red Spot. The remnants of one such eruption are apparent in this photograph. To the lower left of the Red Spot lies one of the three long-lived White Ovals. This photograph was taken on June 29, 1979, when Voyager 2 was over 9 million kilometers (nearly 6 million miles) from Jupiter. The smallest features visible are over 170 kilometers (106 miles) across.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01370.jpg,1979-06-29
Jupiter from Voyager 2,"This image was obtained on June 29, 1979, when Voyager 2 was 9.3 million kilometers (5.6 million miles) from the planet. The view extends from +40 to -40 latitude with size of the smallest discernible features equal to 172 kilometers (106 miles). The broad, orange band extending across the lower half of the picture is the equatorial region of the planet. All brown and white oval-shaped clouds visible in this image were observed by Voyager 1 in early March, illustrating the stability of this type of feature in the Jovian atmosphere. The turbulent region in the lower right-hand corner lies to the west of the Great Red Spot. High velocity westward winds along the southern edge combine with eastern winds along the northern edge to produce the observed effect. These individual features are short-lived.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01369.jpg,1979-06-29
"Uranus, Toward the Planet’s Pole of Rotation","These two pictures of Uranus were compiled from images recorded by Voyager 2 on Jan. 10, 1986, when the NASA spacecraft was 18 million kilometers (11 million miles) from the planet. The images were obtained by Voyager's narrow-angle camera; the view is toward the planet's pole of rotation, which lies just left of center. The picture on the left has been processed to show Uranus as human eyes would see it from the vantage point of the spacecraft. The second picture is an exaggerated false-color view that reveals details not visible in the true-color view -- including indications of what could be a polar haze of smog-like particles. The true-color picture was made by combining pictures taken through blue, green and orange filters. The dark shading of the upper right edge of the disk is the terminator, or day-night boundary. The blue-green appearance of Uranus results from methane in the atmosphere; this gas absorbs red wavelengths from the incoming sunlight, leaving the predominant bluish color seen here. The picture on the right uses false color and contrast enhancement to bring out subtle details in the polar region of the atmosphere. Images shuttered through different color filters were added and manipulated by computer, greatly enhancing the low-contrast details in the original images. Ultraviolet, violet- and orange-filtered images were displayed, respectively, as blue, green and red to produce this false-color picture. The planet reveals a dark polar hood surrounded by a series of progressively lighter convective bands. The banded structure is real, though exaggerated here. The brownish color near the center of the planet could be explained as being caused by a thin haze concentrated over the pole -- perhaps the product of chemical reactions powered by ultraviolet light from the Sun. One such reaction produces acetylene from methane -- acetylene has been detected on Uranus by an Earth-orbiting spacecraft -- and further reactions involving acetylene are known to produce reddish-brown smog-like particles. A similar haze envelopes Saturn's moon Titan; ground-based observations have predicted such a haze in the polar regions of Uranus. The exact identification of the reactions and their products will require additional study. Voyager 2 is heading for a Jan. 24 closest approach to Uranus.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01360.jpg,1986-01-10

Saturn’s Northern Hemisphere,"This false color picture of Saturn's northern hemisphere was assembled from ultraviolet, violet and green images obtained Aug. 19 by Voyager 2 from a range of 7.1 million kilometers (4.4 million miles). The several weather patterns evident include three spots flowing westward at about 15 meters-per-second (33 mph). Although the cloud system associated with the western-most spot is part of this flow, the spot itself moves eastward at about 30 meters-per-second (65 mph). Their joint flow shows the anti-cyclonic rotation of the spot, which is about 3,000 km. (1,900 mi.) in diameter. The ribbon- like feature to the north marks a high-speed jet where wind speeds approach 150 meters-per-second (330 mph).",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01365.jpg,1998-12-05
The Saturnian Moon Enceladus,"This high-resolution image of Enceladus was made from several images obtained Aug. 25, 1981, by Voyager 2 from a range of 119,000 kilometers (74,000 miles). It shows further surface detail on this Saturnian moon. Enceladus is seen to resemble Jupiter's moon Ganymede, which is, however, about 10 times larger. Faintly visible here in light reflected from Saturn is the hemisphere turned away from the sun.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01367.jpg,1981-08-25
Bright Patches on Ariel,"Distinct bright patches are visible on Ariel, the brightest of Uranus' five largest satellites. Voyager 2 obtained this image Jan. 22, 1986, from a distance of 2.52 million kilometers (1.56 million miles). The clear-filter image, obtained with the narrow-angle camera, shows a resolution of 47 km (29 miles). Ariel is about 1,300 km (800 mi) in diameter. This image shows several distinct bright areas that reflect nearly 45 percent of the incident sunlight; on average, the satellite displays a reflectivity of about 25-30 percent. The bright areas are probably fresh water ice, perhaps excavated by impacts. The south pole of Ariel is slightly off center of the disk in this view. Voyager 2 will obtain its best views of the satellite on Jan. 24, at a closest-approach distance of 127,000 km (79,000 mi).",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01351.jpg,1986-01-22

Outer edge of Saturn’s B-ring,"This composite image shows two views of the outer edge of Saturn's B-ring (left) and the inner part of the Cassini Division (right) in the rings. The images were taken on opposite sides of the planet Aug. 25 from a range of 610,000 kilometers (380,000 miles). The dramatic result of this comparison is that the thin eccentric ringlet in the inner gap of the Cassini Division is shown not to match from side to side; moreover, the edge of the B-ring differs by about 50 km. (30 mi.) as well. Scientists believe the distorted shape of the B-ring edge is due to the gravitational influence of the Saturnian satellite Mimas. It is noted, too, that much of the fine B-ring structure also mismatches from side to side, possibly indicating that they are wave phenomena.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01390.jpg,1999-01-05
High Resolution View of Tethys,"This highest-resolution view of Tethys was obtained Aug. 26 when Voyager 2 was 120,000 kilometers (74,500 miles) from this satellite of Saturn. This image was taken 1 1/2 hours after the spacecraft passed through the planet's ring plane. The smallest features visible here are about 2.2 km. (1.4 mi.) across. The heavily cratered terrain implies a very old surface that has changed little since shortly after the solar system formed. Tethys is a bright object made largely of ice; it has a diameter of 1,050 km. (650 mi.).",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01386.jpg,1999-01-05
Image of Saturn’s F-ring,"Voyager 2 took this high-resolution image of Saturn's F-ring Aug. 26 from a distance of 51,500 kilometers (32,000 miles). This closeup view shows that the ring is made up of at least four distinct components. A higher-resolution scan through the F-ring, the result of the star occultation experiment conducted by the spacecraft's photopolarimeter, showed even finer structure in the ring. Voyager 1 showed a braiding effect not evident in this picture. The small black dots are reseau (reference) marks on the camera. The small bright dash in the middle right of the image is a star trail.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01387.jpg,1999-01-06
Pictures of Tethys’ Large Crater,"This series of Voyager 2 pictures of Tethys shows its distinctive large crater, 400 kilometers (250 miles) in diameter, as it rotates toward the termination and limb of this satellite of Saturn. These images were obtained at four-hour intervals beginning late Aug. 24 and ending early the next day; the distances were 1.1 million km. (670,000 mi.), 826,000 km. (510,000 mi.) and 680,000 km. (420,000 mi.), respectively. The crater, the remnant of a large impact, has a central peak and several concentric rings. Some grooves radiating from the center may be formed of material thrown from the crater during the impact. The bottom frame, with the crater in profile, reveals that its floor has risen back to the spherical shape of the satellite, unlike the large crater seen on Tethys sister moon Mimas.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01385.jpg,1999-01-06
Saturn’s Faint Inner D-ring,"Voyager 2 took this picture of Saturn's faint inner D-ring Aug. 25 about 1 hour 48 minutes before the spacecraft's closest approach to Saturn. The range was 195,400 kilometers (121,300 miles) and phase angle was 166`. This view includes the sun's shadow across the ring. Voyager 1 saw this region in a similar view last fall, but this higher-resolution image shows many more ringlets and gaps. The D-ring is very tenuous and has an extremely small optical depth.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01388.jpg,1999-01-05
View of Saturn’s Rings,"This was one of the first pictures obtained once Voyager 2 resumed returning images Aug. 29, 1979 after its scan platform was commanded to view Saturn. Problems with the platform, on which Voyager's cameras and other instruments are mounted, had prevented the return of images for a few days. This view shows some detail and differences in the complex system of rings. The ""reddening"" of the B-ring on the unlit side also was seen in Voyager 1 images. Voyager 2 obtained this picture from a range 3.4 million kilometers (2.1 million miles) through the clear, green and violet filters.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01389.jpg,1979-08-29
Saturn - High-resolution Filtered Image of Enceladus,"This high-resolution filtered image of Enceladus was made from several images obtained Aug. 25 by Voyager 2 from a range of 119,000 kilometers (74,000 miles). It shows further surface detail on this Saturnian moon (also viewed in the accompanying release P-23955C/BW, S-2-50, imaged about the same time). Enceladus is seen to resemble Jupiter's Galilean satellite Ganymede, which is, however, about 10 times larger. Faintly visible here in ""Saturnshine"" is the hemisphere turned away from the sun.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01395.jpg,1999-02-23
Night Side of Titan,"Voyager 2 obtained this wide-angle image of the night side of Titan on Aug. 25, 1979 at a high phase angle of 154` and a range of 907,000 kilometers (563,000 miles). Green and violet images were combined to make this photograph. The result is a view of the extended atmosphere of this satellite of Saturn, the bright orangish ring being caused by the atmosphere's scattering of the incident sunlight. The bluish outer ring is further evidence of scattering by the submicron size particles that extend several hundred kilometers above the main clouds. This type of photograph is a direct indication of Titan's extensive atmosphere.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01393.jpg,1979-08-25
Europa’s Evening Terminator,"This image of the Jovian moon Europa was taken by Voyager 2 the spacecraft passed within 225,000 kilometers. The area shown is about 600 by 800 kilometers, July 9, 1979, as (140,625 miles). and the smallest features visible are about 4 kllometers in size. This image was taken along the evening terminator, which best shows the surface topography of complex narrow ridges, seen as curved bright streaks, 5 to 10 kilometers wide, andAlso visible are dark bands, typically 100 kilometers in length. more diffuse in character, 20 to 40 kilometers wide and hundreds to thousands of kilometers in length. A few features are suggestive of impact craters but are rare, indicating that the surface thought to be dominantly ice is still active, perhaps warmed by tidal heating like Io. The larger icy satellites, Callisto and Ganymede, are evidently colder with much more rigid crusts and ancient impact craters. The complex intersecting of dark markings and bright ridges suggest that the surface has been fractured and material from beneath has welled up to fill the cracks.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01504.jpg,1979-07-09
Ganymede’s Northern Hemisphere,"This color reconstruction of part of the northern hemisphere of Ganymede was made from pictures taken at a range of 313,000 kilometers (194,000 miles). The scene is approximately 1,300 kilometers (806 miles) across. It shows part of dark, densely cratered block which is bound on the south by lighter, and less cratered, grooved terrain. The dark blocks are believed to be the oldest parts of Ganymede's surface. Numerous craters are visible, many with central peaks. The large bright circular features have little relief and are probably the remnants of old, large craters that have been annealed by flow of the icy near-surface material. The closely-spaced arcuate, linear features are probably analogous to similar features on Ganymede which surround a large impact basin. The linear features here may indicate the former presence of a large impact basin to the southwest.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00356.jpg,1999-02-06
Bright Halo Impact Crater on Ganymede,This color picture of Ganymede in the region 30 S 180 W shows features as small as 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) across. Shown is a bright halo impact crater that shows the fresh material thrown out of the crater. In the background is bright grooved terrain that may be the result of shearing of the surface materials along fault planes. The dark background material is the ancient heavily cratered terrain -- the oldest material preserved on the Ganymede surface.,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00357.jpg,1999-02-06
Europa’s Fractured Surface,"This image of Europa, smallest of Jupiter's four Galilean satellites, was acquired by Voyager 2 on July 9, 1979, from a (150,600 miles). Europa, the brightest range of 241,000 kilometers of the Galilean satellites, has a density slightly less than Io, suggesting it has a substantial quantity of water. Scientists previously speculated that the water must have cooled from the interior and formed a mantle of ice perhaps 100 kilometers thick. The complex patterns on its surface suggest that the icy surface was fractured, and that the cracks filled with dark material from below. Very few impact craters are visible on the surface, suggesting that active processes on the surface are still modifying Europa. The tectonic pattern seen on its surface differs drastically from the fault systems seen on Ganymede where pieces of the crust have moved relative to each other. On Europa, the crust evidently fractures but the pieces remain in roughly their original position.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01503.jpg,1979-07-09
Photograph of Saturns’ Satellite Tethys,"This Voyager 2 photograph of Tethys shows objects about 5 kilometers (3 miles) in size and is one of the best images of the Saturnian satellite returned by the spacecraft or its predecessor, Voyager 1. Voyager 2 obtained this picture Aug. 26 from a range of 282,000 kilometers (175,000 miles). It has been specially processed by computer to bring out fine detail on the surface. A boundary between heavily cratered regions (top right) and more lightly cratered areas (bottom right) is very similar to boundaries on the moons Dione and Rhea, indicating a period of internal activity early in Tethys' history that partially resurfaced the older terrain. The large crater in the upper right lies almost on the huge trench system that girdles nearly three-fourths of the circumference of the satellite. The trench itself is seen in this image as a linear set of markings to the lower left of the crater. The trench, several kilometers deep, is indicative of a cold, stiff ice crust at the time of its formation. Formation of this trench system could have resulted from the expansion of Tethys as its warm interior froze.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01397.jpg,1999-03-06
Saturn - Large Crater on Tethys,"Special processing has brought out surface detail in this Voyager 2 image focusing on the large crater on Tethys. The spacecraft took this photograph Aug. 25, when it was 826,000 kilometers (513,000 miles) from the icy moon of Saturn. Here, resolution is about 15 km. (9 mi.). The crater has been flattened by the flow of softer ice and no longer shows the deep bowl shape characteristic of fresh craters in hard, cold ice or rock. It appears to have been formed early in Tethys' history, at a time when its interior was still relatively warm and soft.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01398.jpg,1999-03-06
"Saturn - Enceladus from a Distance of 119,000 kilometers (74,000 miles)","This Voyager 2 mosaic of Enceladus was made from images taken through the clear, violet and green filters Aug. 25, 1981, from a distance of 119,000 kilometers (74,000 miles). In many ways, the surface of this satellite of Saturn resembles that of Jupiter's Galilean satellite Ganymede. Enceladus, however, is only one-tenth Ganymede's size. Some regions of Enceladus show impact craters up to 35 kilometers (22 miles) in diameter, whereas other areas are smooth and uncratered. Linear sets of grooves tens of kilometers long traverse the surface and are probably faults resulting from deformation of the crust. The uncratered regions are geologically young and suggest that Enceladus has experienced a period of relatively recent internal melting. The rims of several craters near the lower center of the picture have been flooded by the smooth terrain. The satellite is about 500 kilometers (310 miles) in diameter and has the brightest and whitest surface of any of Saturn's satellites. Features as small as 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) are visible in this highest-resolution view of Enceladus.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01394.jpg,1981-08-25
Disturbed Region West of the Great Red Spot,"This photo from Voyager 2 was taken on June 9, 1979 and is centered over the long-lived disturbed region west of the Great Red Spot (GRS). Note that the White Oval to the lower left of the GRS has a similar chaotic region of clouds to its west. This particular White Oval, which is not the same one as that seen below the GRS by Voyager 1 in March, 1979, is moving to the right relative to the Red Spot. By the time of Voyager 2's closest approach to Jupiter on July 9, 1979 this Oval will lie just south of the Red Spot. At the time this composite was taken the spacecraft was over 24 million kilometers (15 million miles) from Jupiter. The smallest features which can be seen are roughly 450 kilometers (280 miles) across.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01519.jpg,1979-06-09
"Europa Linear Features from 246,000 kilometers","The first close look ever obtained of Jupiter's satellite, Europa, was taken today, July 9, by Voyager 2 as the spacecraft approached the planet. The linear crack-like features had been seen from a much greater distance last March by Voyager 1. This picture was made at a range of 246,000 kilometers (152,000 miles) and provides a resolution of about four kilometers (2.5 miles). The complicated linear features appear even more like cracks or huge fractures in these images. Also seen are somewhat darker mottled regions which appear to have a slightly pitted appearance, perhaps due to small scale craters. No large craters (more than five kilometers in diameter) are easily identifiable in the Europa photographs to date, suggesting that this satellite has a young surface relative to Ganymede and Callisto, although not perhaps as young as Io's. Various models for Europa's structure will be tested during analysis of these images, including the possibility that the surface is a thin ice crust overlying water or softer ice and that the fracture systems seen are breaks in that crust. Resurfacing mechanisms such as production of fresh ice or snow along the cracks and cold glacier-like flows are being considered as possibilities for removing evidence of impact events. Europa thus appears to truly be a satellite with many properties intermediate between Ganymede and Io.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01523.jpg,1999-03-23
Jupiter White Oval,"This image shows one of the long-lived white oval clouds which have resided in the Jovian southern hemisphere for nearly 40 years. This cloud that is at a longitude west of the Great Red Spot. All of the clouds show very similar internal structures. To the east of each of them, recirculating currents are clearly seen. This photo was taken on July 5 by Voyager 2 from a distance of 3.4 million kilometers.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01521.jpg,1999-03-13
Jupiter’s Equatorial Zone in Exaggerated Color,"This special color composite made from Voyager 2 narrow-angle frames taken on June 28, 1979, has been processed to exaggerate color differences within the naturally colorful Jovian atmosphere. Such processing makes detailed structure in the clouds more apparent. The dark belt across the upper portion of the photograph is the North Equatorial Belt. One of the largest of the long-lived dark features found along the northern edge of this belt is seen in the upper middle of the photograph. Jupiter's Equatorial Zone, which lies across the middle of the photograph, is characterized by a series of wisp-like plume features. The northern bluish edges of these plumes are thought to lie within deeper, warmer levels of the atmosphere. South of the Equatorial Zone lies the chaotic region of whiter clouds found west of the Great Red Spot. kilometers (6.4 million miles) from Jupiter. The smallest features visible in this photograph are about 190 kilometers (119 miles) across.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01524.jpg,1979-06-28
Ganymede’s Varied Terrain,"Voyager 2 took this picture of Ganymede as the spacecraft was nearing its encounter with the ice giant. It was taken from a range of 312,000 kilometers (195,000 miles), and it shows features down to about 5 to 6 kilometers across. Clear examples of several of the different types of terras in common on Ganymede s surface are visible (right).. The boundary of the largest region of dark ancient terrain on Ganymede can be seen to the east (right), revealing some of the light linear features which may be all that remains of a large ancient impact structure similar to the large ring structure on Callisto. The broad light regions running through the image are the typical grooved structures seen within most of the light regions on Ganymede. To the lower left is another example of what might be evidence of large scale lateral motion in Ganymede's crust. The band of grooved terrain (about 100 kilometers wide) in this region appears to be offset by 50 kilometers or more on the left hand edge by a linear feature perpendicular to it. A feature similar to this one was previously discovered by Voyager 1. These are the first clear examples of strike-slip style faulting on any planet other than Earth. Many examples of craters of all ages can be seen in this image, ranging from fresh, bright ray craters to large, subdued circular markings thought to be the ""scars"" of large ancient impacts that have been flattened by glacier-like flows.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01520.jpg,1999-03-13
Saturn’s Northern Mid-latitudes,"In this Voyager 2 observation of Saturn's northern mid-latitudes is seen a strangely curled cloud attached by a thin ribbon to the bright white cloud region to the north. The cloud has been monitored for seven rotations around the planet. It appears to be forming a closed loop. Other discrete clouds are seen to the east. Also evident is the ""ribbonlike"" structure at 47 north latitude in the white cloud region. The spacecraft took this image Aug. 16 from a distance of 9.3 million kilometers (5.8 million miles), when the smallest feature seen was about 90 kilometers (56 miles) across.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01958.jpg,1999-04-25
Photograph of Saturn Constructed in False Color,"This Saturn photograph has been constructed in false color from a green and a violet frame obtained Aug. 19 by Voyager 2 from a range of 7.1 million kilometers (4.4 million miles). In true color, the blue oval in the center of the image would be brown and the two spots below and to the right would be white. The convective structure below the blue oval is moving west at 20 meters-per-second (40 mph) relative to the oval. The wavelike structures in the ribbon to the north are moving eastward at 150 meters-per-second (300 mph). In this image, the smallest observable features are 130 km. (80 mi.) across. The separate green and violet frames used to construct this picture are displayed in an accompanying release (P-23916BW, S-2-13).",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01957.jpg,1999-04-14
Voyager 2 Image of Saturn,"This Voyager 2 image, taken Aug. 18 from a distance of 6.8 million kilometers (4.2 million miles), shows the region extending from 20 north latitude to Saturn's polar region. Several small-scale spots evident at around 37 north move in an easterly jet at a speed approaching 15 meters-per-second (33 mph). Toward the boundary with the white cloud band are several cloud strands that mark part of the westerly flow of the atmosphere. This flow reaches a maximum in the ""ribbonlike"" structure, with wind speeds of about 150 meters-per-second (330 mph). Further cloud bands and small-scale spots can be seen toward Saturn's north pole. The smallest features evident here measure about 65 km. (40 mi.) across.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01956.jpg,1999-04-14
Outer Edge of Saturn’s A-ring,"The outer edge of Saturn's A-ring is detailed in this image obtained by Voyager 2 on Aug. 26, just half an hour before closest approach, at a range of about 51,000 kilometers (31,700 miles). Resolution in this wide-angle view is about 4 km. (2.5 miles). The many sharp linear features parallel to the ring edge are most probably locations where ring particles are in resonance with one of the several small nearby satellites of about 100-km. radius discovered last fall by Voyager 1. Such regions are likely characterized by more intense particle collisions and a greater density of small ""chips."" The entire outer band of the A-ring has different scattering properties and therefore different particle characteristics than the main body of the rings to the upper left.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01953.jpg,1999-04-11
Saturn’s A-ring,"Voyager 2 cameras acquired this photograph of Saturn's A-ring Aug. 26 from a distance of 227,800 kilometers (141,500 miles). This view of the ring's outer edge shows a small bright, clumpy ring within the Encke Gap (center of this image) that exhibits kinks reminiscent of those observed in the F-ring by Voyager 1 last fall but not by Voyager 2. Voyager 1 saw two similar clumpy rings in this region at much lower resolution. Also visible are a bright ringlet at the very outer edge of the A-ring and several bright wave patterns in the Encke region. The small bright patch on the inner edge of the Encke Gap near the ring is an artifact of processing.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01952.jpg,1999-04-11
Saturn’s F-ring and Inner Satellite,"Saturn's F-ring and its inner shepherding satellite (1980S27) are pictured in this closeup Voyager 2 image acquired Aug. 25 from a range of 365,000 kilometers (227,000 miles). Features as small as 6 km. (3.7 mi.) across are visible. The satellite is elongated and irregular, with its longest axis pointing toward the center of Saturn (toward the upper right in this view). As seen here, the F-ring is thin and does not show the multiple, braided structure Voyager 1 saw last fall. Nor is there any indication of a band or kink in the ring at its closest point to the shepherd; such a feature would be consistent with some of the theories advanced on the formation of the braids.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01951.jpg,1999-04-11
Surface of Enceladus,"The surface of Enceladus is seen in this closeup view obtained Aug. 25, when Voyager 2 was 112,000 kilometers (69,500 miles) from this satellite of Saturn. This view, in which Enceladus north pole is toward the bottom right, shows the moon to bear a striking resemblance of Ganymede, the largest Galilean satellite of Jupiter. Moderately cratered areas have been transected by strips of younger grooved terrain. This more recently formed terrain--the light cratering says it must be relatively young--has consumed portions of craters such as those near the bottom center of this picture. This suggests that Enceladus has experienced internal melting even though it is only about 490 km. (300 mi.) in diameter. The grooves and linear features indicate that the satellite has been subjected to considerable crustal deformation as a result of this internal melting. The largest crater visible here is about 35 km. (20 mi.) across.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01950.jpg,1999-04-11
Saturn’s Moon Tethys,"Voyager 2 obtained this view of Saturn's moon Tethys on Aug.25 from a distance of 540,000 kilometers (335,000 miles). It shows the numerous impact craters and fault valleys of a very ancient surface. Tethys itself is 1,090 km. (675 mi.) in diameter, and the great chasm seen at the top of this image extends 1,700 km. (1,050 mi.), halfway across the satellite. The largest impact crater visible here is 90 km. (55 mi.) in diameter.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01399.jpg,1999-04-11
Voyager 2 Image of Saturn,"In this Voyager 2 image of Saturn, obtained Aug. 11, 1981, from a range of 14.7 million kilometers (9.1 million miles), north is at the upper right edge of the disc. Seen above the planet are the satellites Dione (right) and Enceladus. This false-color print shows a green spot at the south edge of a yellow band; in true color, the spot would appear brown and the band white. A bright yellow spot slightly above and to the left in this image moves eastward relative to the green spot at a rate that allows it to pass the green feature in about 50 days. The convective clouds that appear between the two spots are typical of the region. Here, the smallest visible structures measure about 270 kilometers (170 miles).",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01959.jpg,1981-08-11
Spokes on Side of Saturn’s Rings,"Spokes are seen on the unlit side of Saturn's rings for the first time in this Voyager 2 wide-angle view obtained Aug. 28 from a distance of 3.4 million kilometers (2.1 million miles). In order to bring out the very faint detail in the B-ring, the image was specially processed for the spokes and thus does not show the true relative brightness of the other rings. The spokes are visible as bright wedge-shaped and tilted features in the outer half of the B-ring (center of image). A time-lapse sequence to be taken later this week will help resolve the question about whether the spokes are forming on the darkside of the rings or are lit-side features seen through the rings.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01955.jpg,1999-04-11
Collage of Saturn’s Smaller Satellites,"This family portrait shows the smaller satellites of Saturn as viewed by Voyager 2 during its swing through the Saturnian system. The following chart corresponds to this composite photograph (distance from the planet increases from left to right) and lists names, standard numerical designations and approximate dimensions (radii where indicated) in kilometers:",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01954.jpg,1999-04-11
High-resolution View of Saturn’s Rings,"Voyager 2 high-resolution view of Saturn's rings Aug. 23 at a range of 3.3 million kilometers (2 million miles). The planet's limb is visible through the C-ring and the inner part of the B-ring. The ring shadows have been obscured by the bright band of light, evident on Saturn's surface, that passed through the more transparent Cassini Division. The Cassini Division is the darker gap that extends from the lower center of this image to the upper left; it is about 5,000 km. (3,100 mi.) wide. Many bright and dark ringlets are seen throughout the complex ring system.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01962.jpg,1999-04-25
Large Brown Spot in Saturn’s Atmosphere,"Circulation around a large brown spot in Saturn's atmosphere can be seen in this pair of green-filter Voyager 2 images taken Aug. 23 and 24 from distances of 2.7 million and 2.3 million kilometers (1.7 million and 1.4 million miles), respectively. The top frame was taken about 10 hours 15 minutes before that at bottom. Brighter clouds like that seen to the northwest of the spot (to the upper left in these views) are observed in this time-lapse comparison to move in an anti-cyclonic direction (counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere). One interpretation says this anti-cyclonic motion is associated with downdrafts that would induce clearing over the spot. Consequently, the spot itself may represent an opening in Saturn's upper cloud deck through which darker underlying clouds can be seen. The smallest features visible here are more than 50 km. (30 mi.) across.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01963.jpg,1999-04-28
Saturn’s Northern Hemisphere,"These Voyager 2 images of Saturn's northern hemisphere were taken Aug. 19 from a distance of 7.1 million kilometers (4.4 million miles). North is in the upper right corner. Both images show the same region of the planet, but the frame on the right was taken through a violet filter and the one on the left through a green filter. The violet image shows a bright band about 3,000 km. (1,900 mi.) wide north of three bright oval cloud systems. Two of these storms lose contrast in the green image and are barely visible. The third and largest feature, 3,000 km. (1,900 mi.) in diameter, is dark in the green and has a measured clockwise rotation. These two images were used to construct the accompanying color release (P-23915C, S-2-12) detailing the same region of the planet.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01960.jpg,1999-04-25
Saturn’s North Temperate Belt,"In this Voyager 2 false-color photograph, obtained Aug. 20 from a distance of 6.4 million kilometers (4 million miles), north is to the upper left. This view of the northern edge of Saturn's North Temperate Belt, the brownish region in the lower right of the image, was made from frames taken through violet, blue and green filters. The bright disturbance in the lower left has been coiled into a figure ""6"" by the wind shear in the planet's atmosphere; this same feature was seen in an earlier release (P-23912, S-2-9). To the south of it, winds blow westward at 20 meters-per-second (45 mph). Within the white zone to the north, wind speeds are in excess of 130 meters-per-second (290 mph) to the east. Wavelike structures can be seen along the ribbon feature that roughly follows the core of this strong eastward-flowing jet. The smallest observable features in this image are about 120 km. (75 mi.) across.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01961.jpg,1999-04-25
Saturn’s Ring Region,"This long exposure of the ring region about 150,000 to 200,000 kilometers (90,000 to 120,000 miles) from the center of Saturn captured the very faint G-ring, seen at left. The ring was discovered by Voyager 1 last fall at a similar phase angle. Voyager 2 was about 305,000 km. (189,000 mi.) away when it took this image Aug. 26. The small rectangular dots forming a regular pattern are reseau (reference) marks on the Voyager vidicon camera. The high-resolution detail in the A-ring has been washed out by the very long exposure needed to bring out the very tenuous G-ring.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01964.jpg,1999-04-28
Saturn’s B and C-rings,"This view focusing on Saturn's C-ring (and to a lesser extent, the B-ring at top and left) was compiled from three separate images taken through ultraviolet, clear and green filters. On Aug. 23, when it acquired these frames, Voyager 2 was 2.7 million kilometers (1.7 million miles) from the planet. More than 60 bright and dark ringlets are evident here; the small, bland squares are caused by the removal of reseau (reference) marks during processing. In general, C-ring material is very bland and gray, the color of dirty ice. Color differences between this ring and the B-ring indicate differing surface compositions for the material composing these complex structures.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01531.jpg,1999-05-08
Complex Geologic History of Triton,"Part of the complex geologic history of icy Triton, Neptune's largest satellite, is shown in this Voyager 2 photo, which has a resolution of 900 meters (2,700 feet) per picture element. The photo was received as part of a Triton-mapping sequence between 3:30 and 5:30 a.m. (PDT). This view is about 500 kilometers (300 miles) across. It encompasses two depressions, possibly old impact basins, that have been extensively modified by flooding, melting, faulting, and collapse. Several episodes of filling and partial removal of material appear to have occurred. The rough area in the middle of the bottom depression probably marks the most recent eruption of material. Only a few impact craters dot the area, which shows the dominance of internally driven geologic processes on Triton.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01538.jpg,1999-05-08
Saturn and its Ring System,"Voyager 2 returned this view of Saturn and its ring system Aug. 11, when the spacecraft was 13.9 million kilometers (8.6 million miles) away and approaching the large, gaseous planet at about l million km. (620,000 mi.) a day. The ring system's shadow is clearly cast in the equatorial region. Storm clouds and small-scale spots in the mid-latitudes are apparent. The so-called ""ribbonlike"" feature in the white cloud band marks a high-speed jet at about 47 north; there, the westerly wind speeds are about 150 meters-per-second (330 mph). The banding on this large, gaseous planet extends toward both poles.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01966.jpg,1999-05-06
"Saturn’s Outer Satellite, Phoebe","Voyager 2 took this photo of Saturn's outer satellite, Phoebe, on Sept. 4, 1981, from 2.2 million kilometers (1.36 million miles) away. The photo shows that Phoebe is about 200 kilometers (120 miles) in diameter, about twice the size of Earth-based measurements; and dark, with five percent reflectivity -- much darker than any other Saturnian satellite. That, and information from Earth-based observations, indicates Phoebe is almost certainly a captured asteroid, and did not form in the original Saturn nebula as Saturn's other satellites did. Phoebe is the only Saturnian satellite that does not always show the same face to Saturn: Its orbital period is 550 days. Its rotation period (length of day), determined from Voyager 2 observations, is nine to ten hours. Other ground-based observations that indicate that Phoebe is a captured asteroid: It orbits Saturn in the ecliptic plane (the plane in which Earth and most other planets orbit the Sun), rather than in Saturn's equatorial plane as the other Saturn satellites do. And Phoebe's orbit is retrograde -- in the direction opposite to that of the other satellites.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01965.jpg,1999-05-06
Ariel’s Densely Pitted Surface,"This mosaic of the four highest-resolution images of Ariel represents the most detailed Voyager 2 picture of this satellite of Uranus. The images were taken through the clear filter of Voyager's narrow-angle camera on Jan. 24, 1986, at a distance of about 130,000 kilometers (80,000 miles). Ariel is about 1,200 km (750 mi) in diameter; the resolution here is 2.4 km (1.5 mi). Much of Ariel's surface is densely pitted with craters 5 to 10 km (3 to 6 mi) across. These craters are close to the threshold of detection in this picture. Numerous valleys and fault scarps crisscross the highly pitted terrain. Voyager scientists believe the valleys have formed over down-dropped fault blocks (graben); apparently, extensive faulting has occurred as a result of expansion and stretching of Ariel's crust. The largest fault valleys, near the terminator at right, as well as a smooth region near the center of this image, have been partly filled with deposits that are younger and less heavily cratered than the pitted terrain. Narrow, somewhat sinuous scarps and valleys have been formed, in turn, in these young deposits. It is not yet clear whether these sinuous features have been formed by faulting or by the flow of fluids.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01534.jpg,1986-01-24

Triton Faults,"This image of Triton was taken from a distance of about 130,000 kilometers (80,000 miles) at 12:20 a.m. PDT Aug. 25 1989. The image was received at JPL four hours later at about 4:20 a.m. The smallest detail that can be seen is about 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) across. The long linear feature extending vertically across the image is probably a graben (a narrow down dropped fault block) about 35 kilometers (20 miles) across. The ridge in the center of the graben probably is ice that has welled up by plastic flow in the floor of the graben. The surrounding terrain is a relatively young icy surface with few impact craters.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01537.jpg,1999-05-08
Detail of Triton’s Surface,"This color photo of Neptune's large satellite Triton was obtained on Aug. 24 1989 at a range of 530,000 kilometers (330,000 miles). The resolution is about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles), sufficient to begin to show topographic detail. The image was made from pictures taken through the green, violet and ultraviolet filters. In this technique, regions that are highly reflective in the ultraviolet appear blue in color. In reality, there is no part of Triton that would appear blue to the eye. The bright southern hemisphere of Triton, which fills most of this frame, is generally pink in tone as is the even brighter equatorial band. The darker regions north of the equator also tend to be pink or reddish in color.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01536.jpg,1999-05-08
Titan’s Cloud Systems,"This Voyager 2 photograph of Titan, taken Aug. 23, 1981 from a range of 2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles), shows some detail in the cloud systems on this Saturnian moon. The southern hemisphere appears lighter in contrast, a well-defined band is seen near the equator, and a dark collar is evident at the north pole. All these bands are associated with cloud circulation in Titan's atmosphere. The extended haze, composed of submicron-size particles, is seen clearly around the satellite's limb. This image was composed from blue, green and violet frames.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01532.jpg,1981-08-23

Jupiter Ring System,"Jupiter's faint ring system is shown in this color composite as two light orange lines protruding from the left toward Jupiter's limb. This picture was taken in Jupiter's shadow through orange and violet filters. The colorful images of Jupiter's bright limb are evidence of the spacecraft motion during these long exposures. The Voyager 2 spacecraft was at a range of 1,450,000 kilometers (900,000 miles) about two degrees below the plane of the ring. The lower ring image was cut short by Jupiter's shadow on the ring.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01529.jpg,1999-05-08
Uranus Satellite - Miranda,"This Voyager 2 image of Miranda was taken Jan. 23, 1986, as the spacecraft neared Uranus. This image was acquired from a distance of 1.38 million kilometers (860,000 miles) through the clear filter of Voyager's narrow-angle camera. Miranda is the innermost of the five Uranian satellites known from Earth-based observations. Images from the Jan. 24 closest approach to Miranda should reveal in greater detail the region toward the bottom of this view, where a sinuous bright marking crosses a circular dark area. These features lie between a bright (high-albedo) region at left and a region of average albedo at right. Miranda is about 500 km (300 mi) in diameter; the resolution of this image is about 26 km (16 mi).",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01980.jpg,1986-01-23
Epsilon Ring of Uranus,"Voyager 2 acquired this high-resolution image of the epsilon ring of Uranus on Jan. 23, 1986, from a distance of 1.12 million kilometers (690,000 miles). This clear-filter image from Voyager's narrow-angle camera has a resolution of about 10 km (6 mi). The epsilon ring, approximately 100 km (60 mi) wide at this location, clearly shows a structural variation. Visible here are a broad, bright outer component about 40 km (25 mi) wide; a darker middle region of comparable width; and a narrow, bright inner strip about 15 km (9 mi) wide. The epsilon-ring structure seen by Voyager is similar to that observed from the ground with stellar-occultation techniques. This frame represents the first Voyager image that resolves these features within the epsilon ring. The occasional fuzzy splotches on the outer and inner parts of the ring are artifacts left by the removal of reseau marks (used for making measurements on the image).",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01983.jpg,1986-01-23
Rings of Uranus,"This Voyager 2 image of the Uranian rings delta, gamma, eta, beta and alpha (from top) was taken Jan. 23, 1986. The spacecraft was 1.12 million kilometers (690,000 miles) away when its narrow-angle camera obtained this clear-filter view. This image illustrates the broad outer component and narrow inner component of the eta ring, which orbits Uranus at a radius of some 47,000 km (29,000 mi). The broad component is considerably more transparent than the dense, narrow inner eta component, as well as the other narrow rings shown. Resolution here is about 10 km (6 mi).",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01981.jpg,1986-01-23
Rings of Uranus,"This silhouetted image of the rings of Uranus was taken by the Voyager 2 spacecraft on Jan. 24, 1986, just 27 minutes before its closest approach to the planet. A half-second exposure was made with the wide-angle camera at a distance of 63,300 kilometers (39,300 miles). This image shows the nine originally known rings appearing as dark lines against the brighter clouds of the planet. The most prominent ring, called epsilon, appears at the right; barely visible at the left are the three rings known simply as 4, 5 and 6. The Uranian rings are extremely dark. The unique geometry of this view --with the rings against a bright background -- was chosen to ensure that an image could be obtained with a relatively fast exposure. The relative widths and spacing of the rings appear slightly different from other views because of the effects of foreshortening and ring inclinations. The resolution of the image is about 9 km (5 miles).",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01985.jpg,1986-01-24
Jupiter’s Violent Storms,"This Voyager 2 image shows the region of Jupiter extending from the equator to the southern polar latitudes in the neighborhood of the Great Red Spot. A white oval, different from the one observed in a similar position at the time of the Voyager 1 encounter, is situated south of the Great Red Spot. The region of white clouds now extends from east of the red spot and around its northern boundary, preventing small cloud vortices from circling the feature. The disturbed region west of the red spot has also changed since the equivalent Voyager 1 image. It shows more small scale structure and cloud vortices being formed out of the wave structures. The picture was taken on July 3 from 6 million kilometers (3.72 million miles).",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01527.jpg,1999-06-22
Uranus’ Rings,"Voyager 2 took this wide-angle image of Uranus' rings as the spacecraft neared the plane of the rings less than an hour before closest approach to the planet. Voyager obtained this clear-filter image on Jan. 24, 1986, from a distance of about 117,000 kilometers (73,000 miles) from Uranus; resolution is about 16 km (10 mi). Running diagonally from upper left to lower center are the four sets of previously known discrete rings. Barely visible to the right of these appears the ansa of a very broad, faint ring not seen before. (The ansa is the portion of a ring visible on either side of a planet when viewed from a distance.) This inner ring extends about 3,000 km (1,900 mi) in width and is located approximately 1,500 km (900 mi) inside the innermost of the previously known discrete rings, the 6 ring. These figures place the inner edge of the newly found ring about 11,000 km (7,000 mi) above the cloud tops of Uranus. Since the ring is so faint, this image has been extensively processed, resulting in the blurry, patchy appearance. The diagram at right shows the positions of the inner ring and the four outer sets of rings.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01984.jpg,1986-01-24
Uranus - Family Portrait,"This ""family portrait"" of Uranus' five largest moons was compiled from images sent back Jan. 20, 1986, by the Voyager 2 spacecraft. The pictures were taken through a clear filter from distances of 5.0 million to 6.1 million kilometers (3.1 million to 3.8 million miles). In this comparison, we see the relative sizes and relativities of the satellites. From left, in order of increasing distance from the planet, they are Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon. The two largest, Oberon and Titania, are about half the size of Earth's Moon, or roughly, 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) in diameter. Miranda, smallest of the five, has about one-quarter to one-third the diameter. Even in these distant views, the satellites exhibit distinct differences in appearance. On average, Oberon and Titania reflect about 20 percent of the sunlight, Umbriel about 12 percent, Ariel and Miranda about 30 percent. Ariel shows the largest contrast on its surface, with the brightest areas about 25 percent. All five satellites show only slight color variations on their surfaces, with their average color being very nearly gray. The best views of the satellites will be obtained Jan. 24, the day of closest approach.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01975.jpg,1986-01-20
Uranus Rings,"Voyager 2 returned this picture of the Uranus rings on Jan. 22, 1986, from a distance of 2.52 million kilometers (1.56 million miles). All nine known rings are visible in this image, a 15-second exposure through the clear filter on Voyager's narrow-angle camera. The rings are quite dark and very narrow. The most prominent and outermost of the nine, called epsilon, is seen at top. The next three in toward Uranus -- called delta, gamma and eta -- are much fainter and more narrow than the epsilon ring. Then come the beta and alpha rings and finally the innermost grouping, known simply as the 4, 5 and 6 rings. The last three are very faint and are at the limit of detection for the Voyager camera. Uranus' rings range in width from about 100 km (60 mi) at the widest part of the epsilon ring to only a few kilometers for most of the others. This image was processed to enhance these narrow features; the bright dots are imperfections on the camera detector. The resolution scale is approximately 50 km (30 mi).",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01977.jpg,1986-01-22
Uranus Rings and Two Moons,"Voyager 2 has discovered two ""shepherd"" satellites associated with the rings of Uranus. The two moons -- designated 1986U7 and 1986U8 -- are seen here on either side of the bright epsilon ring; all nine of the known Uranian rings are visible. The image was taken Jan. 21, 1986, at a distance of 4.1 million kilometers (2.5 million miles) and resolution of about 36 km (22 mi). The image was processed to enhance narrow features. The epsilon ring appears surrounded by a dark halo as a result of this processing; occasional blips seen on the ring are also artifacts. Lying inward from the epsilon ring are the delta, gamma and eta rings; then the beta and alpha rings; and finally the barely visible 4, 5 and 6 rings. The rings have been studied since their discovery in 1977, through observations of how they diminish the light of stars they pass in front of. This image is the first direct observation of all nine rings in reflected sunlight. They range in width from about 100 km (60 mi) at the widest part of the epsilon ring to only a few kilometers for most of the others. The discovery of the two ring moons 1986U7 and 1986U8 is a major advance in our understanding of the structure of the Uranian rings and is in good agreement with theoretical predictions of how these narrow rings are kept from spreading out. Based on likely surface brightness properties, the moons are of roughly 20- and 30-km diameter, respectively.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01976.jpg,1986-01-21
Saturn’s Atmosphere,"Further details of Saturn's atmosphere are evident in this photograph, a black-and-white print of a green-filter frame taken Aug. 21 by Voyager 2. At the time, the spacecraft was 4.6 million kilometers (2.8 million miles) from the planet; at this distance, the smallest observable feature was 85 km. (50 mi.) across. The dark oval cloud is about 4,000 km. (2,400 mi.) in diameter. Near its lower left edge, zonal winds blow westward at 20 meters-per-second (45 mph). By comparison, east-flowing winds reach speeds of 150 meters-per-second (330 mph) along the wavy edge of the white ribbon to the north of the dark oval. The observed flow patterns in the clouds reveal the wind shear to which they are subjected.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01973.jpg,1999-06-16
Ganymede,"This Voyager 2 color photo of Ganymede, the largest Galilean satellite, was taken on July 7, 1979, from a range of 1.2 million kilometers. Most of this portion of Ganymede will be imaged at high resolution during closest approach with the satellite on the evening of July 8, 1979. The photo shows a large dark circular feature about 3200 kilometers in diameter with narrow closely-spaced light bands traversing its surface. The bright spots dotting the surface are relatively recent impact craters, while lighter circular areas may be older impact areas. The light branching bands are ridged and grooved terrain first seen on Voyager 1 and are younger than the more heavily cratered dark regions. The nature of the brightish region covering the northern part of the dark circular feature is uncertain, but it may be some type of condensate. Most of the features seen on the surface of Ganymede are probably both internal and external responses of the very thick icy layer which comprises the crust of this satellite.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01972.jpg,1979-07-07
Full-disk View of Titania,"Voyager 2 obtained this full-disk view of Uranus' moon Titania in the early morning hours of Jan. 24, 1986, from a distance of about 500,000 kilometers (300,000 miles). Many circular depressions -- probably impact craters -- are visible in this clear-filter image returned by the Voyager narrow-angle camera. Other bright spots are distinguished by radiating rays and are probably halo craters that mark relatively more recent impacts. Even more interesting are linear troughs (right) that are probably fault canyons. The troughs break the crust in two directions, an indication of some tectonic extension of Titania's crust. These features indicate that this icy satellite has a dynamic, active interior. Titania is about 1,600 km (1,000 mi) in diameter; the resolution of this image is about 9 km (6 mi).",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01979.jpg,1986-01-24
Uranus Moon - Titania,"The terminator region of Titania, one of Uranus' five large moons, was captured in this Voyager 2 image obtained in the early morning hours of Jan. 24, 1986. Voyager was about 500,000 kilometers (300,000 miles) from Titania and inbound toward closest approach. This clear-filter, narrow-angle view is along the terminator -- the line between the sunlit and darkened parts of the moon. The low-angle illumination shows the shape of the surface very clearly. Among the features visible are long linear valleys perhaps 50-100 km (30-60 mi) wide and several hundred km (or mi) long. At least two directions of faulting are visible, as are many circular impact craters attributed to cosmic debris. The resolution of this image is about 9 km (6 mi).",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01978.jpg,1986-01-24
Uranus Moon - 1985U1,"Several craters are seen on the surface of 1985U1, one of several small moons of Uranus discovered by Voyager 2. The spacecraft acquired this single image -- the only close-up it obtained of any of the new moons -- on Jan. 24, 1986. At the time, Voyager was at a distance of about 500,000 kilometers (300,000 miles) from 1985U1, yielding a resolution of about 10 km (6 mi) in this clear-filter, narrow-angle image. The moon was found Dec. 30, 1985; it was the first and largest of nearly a dozen satellites discovered by the spacecraft cameras. This image shows 1985U1 to be a dark, nearly spherical object, with a diameter of about 150 km (90 mi); the dark surface reflects only 7 percent of the incident light. The picture was inserted into the Voyager encounter sequence late in its development. This image has had a complex history, having been recorded on the spacecraft tape recorder and first played back during the late afternoon of Jan. 24. An antenna-pointing problem at one of the Australian tracking stations led to loss of the data, so the image had to be transmitted a second time. It was successfully received shortly before 6 p.m. PST Jan. 26.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01357.jpg,1985-12-30
Io,"This Voyager 2 picture of Io was taken in ultraviolet light on the evening of July 4, 1979, at a range of 4.7 million kilometers (2.9 million miles). The bright spot on the right limb is one of the volcanic eruption plumes first photographed by Voyager 1. The plume is more than 200 kilometers (124 miles) high. The volcano apparently has been erupting since it was observed by Voyager 1 in March. This suggests that the volcanos on Io probably are in continuous eruption.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01989.jpg,1979-07-04
Saturn’s A-Ring,"This view of Saturn's A-ring was obtained Aug. 23, when Voyager 2 was about 2.8 million kilometers (1.7 million miles) from the planet. Green, violet and ultraviolet image of the ring, which images were used to compile this is 15,000 km. (9,300 mi.) wide. Of note here are the Cassini Division, in the extreme lower right corner of this image; the Encke Division, the prominent gap in the A-ring, at upper left; and the inner F-ring shepherding satellite (1980S27), near the top of the frame.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01988.jpg,1999-07-23
Neptune - Full Ring System,"This pair of Voyager 2 images (FDS 11446.21 and 11448.10), two 591-s exposures obtained through the clear filter of the wide angle camera, show the full ring system with the highest sensitivity. Visible in this figure are the bright, narrow N53 and N63 rings, the diffuse N42 ring, and (faintly) the plateau outside of the N53 ring (with its slight brightening near 57,500 km).",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02202.jpg,1999-07-30
Neptune - Partial Rings,"One of two new ring arcs, or partial rings, discovered today by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft, is faintly visible here just outside the orbit of the Neptunian moon 1989N4, also discovered by Voyager 2 earlier this month. The 155 second exposure taken by Voyager's narrow-angle camera shows the glare of an overexposed Neptune to the right of the moon and ring arc. The two bright streaks below the moon and ring arc are stars. The ring arc is approximately 50,000 kilometers (or 30,000 miles) long. (The second ring arc, not apparent here, is approximately 10,000 kilometers (6,000 miles) long and is associated with the moon 1989N3.) The ring arc, along with 1989N4, orbits about 62,000 kilometers (38,000 miles) from the planet's center, or about 37,000 kilometers (23,000 miles) from the planet's cloud tops. Astronomers have long suspected the existence of such an irregular ring system around Neptune. Data from repeated ground based observations hinted at the existence of irregular strands of partial rings orbiting Neptune. Voyager's photographs of the ring arcs are the first photographic evidence that such a ring system exists. Voyager scientists said the ring arcs may be comprised of debris associated with the nearby moons, or may be the remnants of moons that have been torn apart or ground down through collisions. Close-up studies of the ring arcs by Voyager 2 in coming days should help determine their composition.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02200.jpg,1999-07-25
Neptune Through a Clear Filter,"On July 23, 1989, the Voyager 2 spacecraft took this picture of Neptune through a clear filter on its narrow-angle camera. The image on the right has a latitude and longitude grid added for reference. Neptune's Great Dark Spot is visible on the left limb of the planet at about 22.5 degrees south latitude. In previous photographs, less detail was visible; now additional structure associated with the dark spot has become apparent. The jagged right edge of the large spot is real and is probably caused by cloud motion. Voyager 2 was about 47 million kilometers (29 million miles) from Neptune when this picture was taken. The smaller dark spot in the southern dark band is visible on the lower right with a small, light circle at its center.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01999.jpg,1989-07-23
Neptune,"This image of Neptune was taken through the clear filter of the narrow-angle camera on July 16 when the Voyager 2 spacecraft was at a range of 57,000,000 kilometers (35 million miles). The image was processed by computer to show the newly resolved dark oval feature embedded in the middle of the dusky southern collar. The large dark spot nearer the equator is also prominent on the left edge of the disk. The new small dark spot rotates faster than the large dark spot indicating that the winds on Neptune have different velocities at different latitudes as is the case for Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01998.jpg,1999-07-25
Neptune - Two Images,"These two images of Neptune were taken by Voyager 2's narrow angle camera when the spacecraft was about 12 million km (7.5 million miles) from Neptune. Resolution is about 110 km (68 miles) per pixel. During the 17.6 hours between the left and right images, the Great Dark Spot, at 22 degrees south latitude (left of center), has completed a little less than one rotation of Neptune. The smaller dark spot, at 54 south, completed a little more than one rotation, as can be seen by comparing its relative positions in the two pictures. The Great Dark Spot and the smaller spot have a relative velocity of 100 meters per second (220 miles an hour). The light and dark bands circling Neptune indicate predominantly zonal (east/west) motion. The diffuse white feature north of the Great Dark Spot is near Neptune's equator, and rotates with about the same period as the Great Dark Spot. Streak of bright clouds at the south edge, and just east of the Great Dark Spot, are its constant companions, and change the details of their appearance, often within a few hours. Changing brightness of the cloud streaks could be a result of vertical motions.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01993.jpg,1999-07-25
Neptune - Dark Feature,"This clear filter image was acquired by Voyager 2 on August 14, 1989, at a range of 14.8 million kilometers (9.2 million miles). The image shows a dark feature extending westward (left) and northward (up) toward the equator from the Great Dark Spot (GDS). This puzzling phenomenon developed over a relatively short period (three rotations or about 54 hours), and continues to evolve with time. Further study may reveal whether this protrusion represents an actual flow of dark cloud material from the GDS or is a result of atmospheric disturbances associated with the western boundary of the GDS. Bright, wispy ""cirrus type"" clouds are seen overlying the GDS at its southern (lower) margin and over its northwest (upper left) boundary. This is the first evidence that the GDS lies lower in the atmosphere than the bright clouds, which have remained in its vicinity for several months. Increasing detail in global banding and in the south polar region is also apparent.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01992.jpg,1989-08-14
Neptune - Three New Satellites,"This image captured by the Voyager 2 spacecraft was used to confirm the discovery of three new satellites orbiting Neptune. The 46 second exposure was taken by Voyager 2's narrow angle camera through a clear filter on July 30, 1989, when the spacecraft was about 37.3 million kilometers (23.6 million miles) from Neptune. The large globe of the planet itself is severely overexposed and appears pure white. The image has been computer processed to accentuate the new moons, which otherwise would appear little stronger than background noise. The satellite 1989 N1, at right in this frame, was discovered by Voyager 2 in early July 1989. The new satellites confirmed this week are 1989 N2, 1989 N3 and 1989 N4. Each of the moons appears as a small streak, an effect caused by movement of the spacecraft during the long exposure. The new moons occupy nearly circular and equatorial orbits ranging from about 27,300 to 48,300 kilometers (17,000 to 30,000 miles) from Neptune's cloud tops, and are estimated to range in diameter from about 100 to 200 kilometers (about 60 to 125 miles).",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01991.jpg,1989-07-30
Neptune - Dark Oval,"The large, dark oval spot in Neptune's atmosphere is just coming into view in this picture returned from the Voyager 2 spacecraft on June 30, 1989. The spacecraft was about 83 million kilometers (51.5 million miles) from Neptune. Voyager scientists are interested in the dark oval cloud system, a very large system similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. Contrast of the features in Neptune's atmosphere is similar to that obtained at Saturn at about this same distance and lighting, whereas the features are similar to those seen at Jupiter.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01990.jpg,1989-06-30
Rings of Neptune,"These two 591-second exposures of the rings of Neptune were taken with the clear filter by the Voyager 2 wide-angle camera on Aug. 26, 1989 from a distance of 280,000 kilometers (175,000 miles). The two main rings are clearly visible and appear complete over the region imaged. The time between exposures was one hour and 27 minutes. [During this period the bright ring arcs in the outer bright ring were not visible in either picture (they were unfortunately on the opposite side of the planet for each exposure).] Also visible in this image is the inner faint ring at about 42,000 kilometers (25,000 miles) from the center of Neptune, and the faint band which extends smoothly from the 53,000 kilometer (33,000 miles) ring to roughly halfway between the two bright rings. Both of these newly discovered rings are broad and much fainter than the two narrow rings. These long exposure images were taken while the rings were back-lighted by the sun at a phase angle of 135 degrees. This viewing geometry enhances the visibility of dust and allows fainter, dusty parts of the ring to be seen. The bright glare in the center is due to over-exposure of the crescent of Neptune. The two gaps in the upper part of the outer ring in the image on the left are due to blemish removal in the computer processing. Numerous bright stars are evident in the background. Both bright rings have material throughout their entire orbit, and are therefore continuous.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01997.jpg,1989-08-26
Neptune - Closest Approach,"The Voyager spacecraft took this picture after closest approach to Neptune on Aug. 25 1989, using the clear filter of the wide-angle camera with an exposure time of 255 seconds. The view back towards Neptune at a phase angle of 135 degrees found the two known rings to be five to 10 times brighter than seen in backscattering during Voyager approach at much lower phase angle. This brightness increase implies a large percentage of microscopic particles within the rings. Although the dominant arc-like clump of the outer ring is not seen here, the inner ring appears brighter than the outer ring at the longitudes seen in this image. A faint sheet of material is also revealed that extends from the faint ring at a radius of 53,200 kilometers(33,000 miles). A new and even fainter ring was discovered in this image at about 41,000 kilometers (25,400 miles), seen running from the lower left corner to about one-third the way across the top of the frame. This ring is quite broad, about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) in radial width. In contrast to the two previously discovered rings, this feature is quite diffuse and has no well defined radial boundaries. The Voyager imaging experiment has now detected ring material in all of the radial regions in which it has been detected by groundbased stellar occultation experiments. The Voyager spacecraft was 720,000 kilometers (446,400 miles) from Neptune at the time of this exposure.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01996.jpg,1999-07-25
Neptune’s South Polar Region,"This image of Neptune's south polar region was obtained by the NASA Voyager narrow-angle camera on Aug. 23, 1989, when it was at a distance of 25 million kilometers (1.6 million miles). The smallest cloud features are 45 kilometers (28 miles) in diameter. The image shows the discovery of shadows in Neptune's atmosphere, shadows cast onto a deep cloud bank by small elevated clouds. Located at about 68 degrees south latitude, they are the first cloud shadows ever seen by the Voyager on any planet. The dark regions adjacent to the small bright clouds are believed to be shadows, because they are on the side of the cloud that is opposite to the incoming sunlight and because they lengthen in places where the sun lies closer to the horizon. Estimates of the height of these discrete clouds above the underlying cloud bank can be obtained by careful analysis of this data.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01995.jpg,1989-08-23
Triton - Neptune’s Largest Satellite,"Already intriguing patterns of unknown origin appear on the surface of Neptune's largest satellite, Triton, in this image returned by Voyager 2. The image was taken Aug. 22, 1989, from a distance of 4 million km (2.5 million miles). Voyager images show that Triton's diameter is about 2,720 kn (1,690 miles), and that it is one of the brightest objects in the solar system, reflecting about 70 percent of the sunlight that strikes it. This is the hemisphere of Triton that always faces away from Neptune. The south pole is near the bottom of the image. Triton's rotation axis is tilted so that the latitude at the center of the disk is 55 degrees south. Dark regions at the top of the disk extend from roughly the equator to beyond 20 degrees north. The margin between the bright and dark regions varies with longitude around the satellite. The gray, featureless area just to the right of the center of the disk is due to a reseau (reticule mark) in the camera. Voyager 2 will make its closest approach to Triton on Aug. 25, when it will pass within 40,000 km (25,000 miles) of the satellite.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01994.jpg,1989-08-22
"Saturn - Tethys from 594,000 kilometers (368,000 miles) Away","Voyager 2 obtained this image of Tethys on Aug. 25, when the spacecraft was 594,000 kilometers (368,000 miles) from this satellite of Saturn. This photograph was compiled from images taken through the violet, clear and green filters of Voyager's narrow-angle camera. Tethys shows two distinct types of terrain--bright, densely cratered regions; and relatively dark, lightly cratered planes that extend in a broad belt across the satellite. The densely cratered terrain is believed to be part of the ancient crust of the satellite; the lightly cratered planes are thought to have been formed later by internal processes. Also clearly seen is a trough that runs parallel to the terminator (the day-night boundary, seen at right). This trough is an extension of the huge canyon system Voyager 1 saw last fall. This system extends nearly two-thirds the distance around Tethys.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01392.jpg,1999-08-30
Miranda - Highest Resolution Color Picture,"This color composite of the Uranian satellite Miranda was taken by Voyager 2 on Jan. 24, 1986, from a distance of 147,000 kilometers (91,000 miles). This picture was constructed from images taken through the narrow-angle camera's green, violet and ultraviolet filters. It is the best color view of Miranda returned by Voyager. Miranda, just 480 km (300 mi) across, is the smallest of Uranus' five major satellites. Miranda's regional geologic provinces show very well in this view of the southern hemisphere, imaged at a resolution of 2.7 km (1.7 mi). The dark- and bright-banded region with its curvilinear traces covers about half of the image. Higher-resolution pictures taken later show many fault valleys and ridges parallel to these bands. Near the terminator (at right), another system of ridges and valleys abuts the banded terrain; many impact craters pockmark the surface in this region. The largest of these are about 30 km (20 mi) in diameter; many more lie in the range of 5 to 10 km (3 to 6 mi) in diameter.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00042.jpg,1986-01-24
Limb clouds over Triton,Limb clouds over Triton's south polar cap. Image is stretched to enhance the limb clouds and surface features. The image shows the cloud on the west limb that extends about 100 km along the limb and appears detached over much of its length.,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02203.jpg,1999-08-01
Satellite 1989N2,"These Voyager 2 images of satellite 1989N2 at a resolution of 4.2 kilometers (2.6 miles) per pixel reveal it to be and irregularly shaped, dark object. The satellite appears to have several craters 30 to 50 kilometers (18.5 to 31 miles) across. The irregular outline suggests that this moon has remained cold and rigid throughout much of its history. It is about 210 by 190 kilometers (130 by 118 miles), about half the size of 1989N1. It has a low albedo surface reflecting about 5 percent of the incident light.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02206.jpg,1999-08-08
Neptune’s Rings,"This wide-angle Voyager 2 image, taken through the camera's clear filter, is the first to show Neptune's rings in detail. The two main rings, about 53,000 km (33,000 miles) and 63,000 km (39,000 miles) from Neptune, are 5 to 10 times brighter than in earlier images. The difference is due to lighting and viewing geometry. In approach images, the rings were seen in light scattered backward toward the spacecraft at a 15-degree phase angle. However, this image was taken at a 135-degree phase angle as Voyager left the planet. That geometry is ideal for detecting microscopic particles that forward-scatter light preferentially. The fact that Neptune's rings are so much brighter at that angle means the particle-size distribution is quite different from most of Uranus' and Saturn's rings, which contain fewer dust-size grains. However, a few components of the Saturnian and Uranian ring systems exhibit forward-scattering behavior: The F ring and the Encke Gap ringlet at Saturn, and 1986U1R at Uranus. They are also narrow, clumpy ringlets with kinks, and are associated with nearby moonlets too small to detect directly. In this image, the main clumpy arc, composed of three features each about 6 to 8 degrees long, is clearly seen. This image was obtained when Voyager was 1.1 million km (683,000 miles) from Neptune. Exposure time was 111seconds.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02207.jpg,1999-08-08
Neptune’s Bright Crescent,"Neptune's bright crescent taken in six filters (from bottom to top: UV, violet, blue, clear, green, orange) on 31.3 August 1989. The images were shuttered in temporal order: violet, blue, UV, clear, green, orange. These images how the bright core of D2, the south polar feature, and the symmetric structure immediately surrounding the south pole. The relatively high contrast of the features in these images indicates that they extend above most of the scattering haze and absorbing methate gas in Neptune's atmosphere. [Image processing by D. A. Alexander]",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02204.jpg,1989-08-03
Neptune,"This image of the planet Neptune was taken by the Voyager 2spacecraft on January 23, 1989, about seven months before its scheduled August 25 encounter. The spacecraft was 310 million kilometers (192 million miles) from the planet, looking from 34 degrees south of Neptune's equator through the ""clear"" filter. Similar images from Earth-based telescopes had shown a featureless disk, through red filters, chosen to mark methane gas, revealed irregular-shaped features associated with high-altitude hazes. The Voyager data reveal cloud structure at lower altitudes where the circulation is apparently arranged in parallel east-west bands, as is the case on Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. In the original image, the bright bands are about 10 percent brighter than the dark band circling the South pole. This is about the same contrast shown by Saturn, and ten times more than Uranus. The brightening and sawtooth edge around the right side are artifacts of the data processing.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02205.jpg,1989-01-23
Triton,"Voyager 2 took this picture of Neptune's largest satellite,Triton, from less than 80,000 km (50,000 miles). The image shows an area in Triton's northern hemisphere. The Sun is just above the horizon, so features cast shadows that accentuate height differences. The large, smooth area in the right-hand side of the image shows a single, fresh, impact crater. Otherwise there is no evidence of impacts such as those that have pocked the faces of most of the satellites Voyager 2 has visited. Many low cliffs in the area, bright where they face the Sun, and when they face away from it, suggest and intricate history for Triton. The cliffs might be due either to melting of surface materials or, possibly, caused by unusual fluid materials that flowed sometime in Triton's past.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02208.jpg,1999-08-08
Neptune,"These pictures of Neptune were obtained by Voyager 2 on April 26,1989, at a distance of 176 million kilometers (109 million miles). At the center of the Neptune disc, each pixel covers a square 4 degrees by 4 degrees in latitude. (Each Voyager image contains 800 pixels, picture elements, per line and 800 lines.) Resolution here was 3256 kilometers (2020 miles) per line pair. The violet, clear and orange filters of Voyager's narrow-angle camera were used to produce the color pictures. Image processing enhances contrast of the features. The picture on the right was taken five hours after that at left, during which time the planet rotated 100 degrees. The dark spot visible in the left picture appeared in clear filter images obtained three months earlier. A much brighter, white spot, prominent in the earlier images, has now apparently faded. The white spot near the south pole in the right picture is new. It was visible only faintly in a picture taken 18 hours earlier at the same longitude. This evidence of dynamic activity was unexpected in Neptune's atmosphere because Neptune receives only one-tenth of one percent as much solar energy as does the Earth.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02209.jpg,1989-04-26
Neptune Great Dark Spot in High Resolution,"This photograph shows the last face on view of the Great Dark Spot that Voyager will make with the narrow angle camera. The image was shuttered 45 hours before closest approach at a distance of 2.8 million kilometers (1.7 million miles). The smallest structures that can be seen are of an order of 50 kilometers (31 miles). The image shows feathery white clouds that overlie the boundary of the dark and light blue regions. The pinwheel (spiral) structure of both the dark boundary and the white cirrus suggest a storm system rotating counterclockwise. Periodic small scale patterns in the white cloud, possibly waves, are short lived and do not persist from one Neptunian rotation to the next. This color composite was made from the clear and green filters of the narrow-angle camera.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00052.jpg,1999-08-30
Uranus - Montage of Uranus’ Five Largest Satellites,"Montage of Uranus' five largest satellites.

Crescents of Neptune and Triton,"This dramatic view of the crescents of Neptune and Triton was acquired by Voyager 2 approximately 3 days, 6 and one-half hours after its closest approach to Neptune (north is to the right). The spacecraft is now plunging southward at an angle of 48 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. This direction, combined with the current season of southern summer in the Neptune system, gives this picture its unique geometry. The spacecraft was at a distance of 4.86 million kilometers (3 million miles) from Neptune when these images were shuttered so the smallest detail discernible is approximately 90 kilometers (56 miles). Color was produced using images taken through the narrow-angle camera's clear, orange and green filters. Neptune does not appear as blue from this viewpoint because the forward scattering nature of its atmosphere is more important than its absorption of red light at this high phase angle (134 degrees).",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02215.jpg,1999-08-23
Triton,"This false color image of Triton is a composite of images taken through the violet, green and ultraviolet filters. The image was taken early on Aug. 25, 1989 when Voyager 2 was about 190,000 kilometers (118,000 miles) from Triton's surface. The smallest visible features are about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) across. The image shows a geologic boundary between completely dark materials and patchy light/dark materials. A layer of pinkish material stretches across the center of the image. The pinkish layer must be thin because underlying albedo patterns show through. Several features appear to be affected by the thin atmosphere; the elongated dark streaks may represent particulate materials blown in the same direction by prevailing winds, and the white material may be frost deposits. Other features appear to be volcanic deposits including the smooth, dark materials alongside the long, narrow canyons. The streaks themselves appear to originate from very small circular sources, some of which are white, like the source of the prominent streak near the center of the image. The sources may be small volcanic vents with fumarolic-like activity. The colors may be due to irradiated methane, which is pink to red, and nitrogen, which is white.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02214.jpg,1989-08-25
Miranda,Mosaic of high-resolution images of Miranda. One wide-angle and eight narrow-angle camera images of Miranda were combined in this view. The controlled mosaic was transformed to an orthographic view centered on the south pole. The trapezoidal region (about 200 km on a side) occurs near the south pole and is located near the center of the mosaic. The trapezoid's outer boundary and its internal patterns of ridges and band of contrasting albedo display numerous sharp corners.,https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02217.jpg,1999-08-24

Triton,"Voyager 2 obtained this color image of Triton at a distance of 4 million kilometers (2.5 million miles) at 1 a.m. PDT on Aug. 22, 1989. The picture was made by combining images taken through the green, clear and violet filters. The smallest features seen are about 74 kilometers (46 miles) across. The south pole of Triton is currently tipped toward the sun and it is summer in the southern hemisphere. The south pole is located about a quarter of the way up from the bottom of the image. The bright band near the top of the image nearly coincides with the equator of Triton. One prominent and several smaller bright, wispy streaks extend from the band into the darker northern hemisphere. The prominent wispy streak shows a bluish-white color while the darker northern hemisphere is reddish in color. This may indicate that the streak is freshly deposited frost while the red color in the northern hemisphere may result from methane frost that has been darkened by radiation. Individual markings appear to rotate with the satellite and retain their shapes indicating they are indeed surface features and not in the tenuous atmosphere.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02211.jpg,1989-08-22
Neptune,"This contrast enhanced color picture of Neptune was acquired by Voyager 2 at a range of 14.8 million kilometers (9.2 million miles) on August 14, 1989. It was produced from images taken through the orange, green and violet filters of Voyager's narrow angle camera. As Voyager 2 approaches Neptune, rapidly increasing image resolution is revealing striking new details in the planet's atmosphere, and this picture shows features as small as a few hundred kilometers in extent. Bright, wispy ""cirrus type"" clouds are seen overlying the Great Dark Spot (GDS) at its southern (lower) margin and over its northwest (upper left) boundary. This is the first evidence that the GDS lies lower in the atmosphere than these bright clouds, which have remained in its vicinity for several months. Increasing detail in global banding and in the south polar region can also be seen; a smaller dark spot at high southern latitudes is dimly visible near the limb at lower left.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02210.jpg,1989-08-14
The Limb of Triton,"This natural color image of the limb of Triton was taken early in the morning of Aug. 25 1989, when the Voyager 2 spacecraft was at a distance of about 210,000 kilometers (128,000 miles) from the icy satellite. The largest surface features visible area about 3 miles across. The picture is a composite of images taken through the violet, green and clear filters. The image shows a geologic boundary between a rough, pitted surface to the right and a smoother surface to the left. The change between surface types is gradual. The image also shows a color boundary between pinkish material in the upper part of the image and whiter material in the lower part. The geologic and color boundaries are not the same. That implies that whatever supplies the color is avery thin coating over a different underlying material in which the geologic boundary occurs. The colored coating may be a seasonal frost composed of compounds volatile enough to be sublimated at the very low temperatures (40 °K to 50 °K, or -387.4 °F to -369.4 °F) prevailing near Triton's surface. Possible compositions of the frost layer include methane (which turns red when irradiated), carbon monoxide or nitrogen. The color in this image is somewhat exaggerated: Triton is primarily a white object with a pinkish cast in some areas.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02213.jpg,1999-08-20
Triton,"The smallest features that can be seen in this false color image of Neptune's largest satellite, Triton, are about 47 km (29 miles) across. The image, taken by Voyager 2 early in the morning of Aug. 23, 1989, is a composite of three images taken through ultraviolet, green, and violet filters. The image offers an example of the kinds of puzzles scientists face on the eve of an encounter: Mottling in the bright southern hemisphere may be the result of topography, if Triton's crust is predominantly water ice, which is rigid at Triton's surface temperature. Alternatively, the mottling could be due to markings on a smooth surface, if the crust is composed of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, or methane ice, since they are soft at the same temperature.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02212.jpg,1989-08-23

Neptune’s Clouds,"The bright cirrus-like clouds of Neptune change rapidly, often forming and dissipating over periods of several to tens of hours. In this sequence Voyager 2 observed cloud evolution in the region around the Great Dark Spot (GDS). The surprisingly rapid changes which occur separating each panel shows that in this region Neptune's weather is perhaps as dynamic and variable as that of the Earth. However, the scale is immense by our standards -- the Earth and the GDS are of similar size -- and in Neptune's frigid atmosphere, where temperatures are as low as 55 degrees Kelvin (-360 F), the cirrus clouds are composed of frozen methane rather than Earth's crystals of water ice.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01982.jpg,1999-10-14
Io,"Voyager 2 took this picture of Io on the evening of July 9, 1979, from a range of 1.2 million kilometers. On the limb of Io are two blue volcanic eruption plumes about 100 kilometers high. These two plumes were first seen by Voyager 1 in March, 1979, and are designated Plume 5 (upper) and Plume 6 (lower). They have apparently been erupting for a period of at least 4 months and probably longer. A total of six plumes have been seen by Voyager 2, all of which were first seen by Voyager 1. The largest plume viewed by Voyager 1 (Plume 1) is no longer erupting. Plume 4 was not viewed on the edge of the moon's disc by Voyager 2 and therefore it is not known whether or not it is still erupting. This picture is one of a series taken to monitor the eruptions over a 6 hour period.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01362.jpg,1979-07-09
3 Images of Neptune,"These three images of Neptune were acquired 90 minutes apart by the Voyager 2 spacecraft on April 3, 1989, from a range of 208 million kilometers (129 million miles). Several atmospheric features (clouds) are visible. In addition to the dark band encircling the south polar region, a large dark spot extends from latitude 20 S. to 30 S. and spans 35 degrees in longitude. It rotates with a period between 17 and 18 hours. Relative to the size of the planet, the spot's dimensions are similar to those of the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. These images were taken exclusively through the clear filter of the narrow angle camera, which is most sensitive to blue light. The spot is 10 percent darker than its surroundings. Resolution of the images is about 3850 kilometers (2400 miles) per line pair. Images taken 70 days earlier show either the same spot or a similar spot, which appears darker than its surroundings through the clear filter but brighter through the orange filter. Clouds visible in the orange images are thought to be at higher altitudes than those visible here, and may have different scattering properties at the two wavelengths. The Voyager cameras will be tracking these atmospheric features during the next three months in order to target them for close-up imaging in the days before the spacecraft's closest approach to Neptune on August 24, 1989.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01363.jpg,1989-04-03
Neptune,"This photograph of Neptune shows three of the features that Voyager 2 has been photographing during recent weeks. At the north is the Great Dark Spot, accompanied by bright, white clouds that undergo rapid changes in appearance. To the south of the Great Dark Spot is the bright feature that Voyager scientists have nicknamed ""Scooter."" Still farther south is the feature called ""Dark Spot 2,"" which has a bright core. Each feature moves eastward at a different velocity, so it is only occasionally that they appear close to each other, such as at the time this picture was taken.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02219.jpg,1999-10-14
Neptune’s Rings,"This 591-second exposure of the rings of Neptune were taken with the clear filter by the Voyager 2 wide-angle camera. The two main rings are clearly visible and appear complete over the region imaged. Also visible in this image is the inner faint ring and the faint band which extends smoothly from the ring roughly halfway between the two bright rings. Both of these newly discovered rings are broad and much fainter than the two narrow rings. The bright glare is due to over-exposure of the crescent on Neptune. Numerous bright stars are evident in the background. Both bright rings have material throughout their entire orbit, and are therefore continuous.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02224.jpg,1999-10-29
Neptune Shadows,"This image of Neptune shows the discovery of shadows in Neptune's atmosphere, shadows cast onto a deep cloud band by small elevated clouds. They are the first cloud shadows ever seen by Voyager on any planet. Estimates of the height of these discrete clouds above the underlying cloud bank can be obtained by careful analysis of this data.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02220.jpg,1999-10-15

Neptune Clouds on the Dark Spot,"This photo was taken by Voyager 2's wide-angle camera. Light at methane wavelengths is mostly absorbed in the deeper atmosphere. The bright, white feature is a high-altitude cloud just south of the Great Dark Spot. Other, smaller clouds associated with the Great Dark Spot are white, and are also at high altitudes.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02222.jpg,1999-10-29
Neptune’s Small Dark Spot (D2),"This bulls-eye view of Neptune's small dark spot (D2) was obtained by Voyager 2's narrow-angle camera. Banding surrounding the feature indicates unseen strong winds, while structures within the bright spot suggest both active upwelling of clouds and rotation about the center. A rotation rate has not yet been measured, but the V-shaped structure near the right edge of the bright area indicates that the spot rotates clockwise. Unlike the Great Red Spot on Jupiter, which rotates counterclockwise, if the D2 spot on Neptune rotates clockwise, the material will be descending in the dark oval region. The fact that infrared data will yield temperature information about the region above the clouds makes this observation especially valuable.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02223.jpg,1999-10-29
Saturn’s outer satellite - Phoebe,"Voyager 2 took these images of Saturn's outer satellite Phoebe, on Sept. 4, 1981, from 2.2 million kilometers (1.36 million miles) away. This pair shows two different hemispheres of the satellite. The left image shows a bright mountain on the upper right edge reflecting the light of the setting sun. This mountain is possibly the central peak of a large impact crater taking up most of the upper right quadrant of Phoebe in this view. The right images shows a hemisphere with an intrinsically bright spot in the top portion of the image as well as the ridges appearing bright in the sunset light of the lower right. These images were processed by the Multimission Image Processing Laboratory of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02229.jpg,1999-12-10
Saturn - North Polar Region,"The north polar region of Saturn is pictured in great detail in this Voyager 2 image obtained Aug. 25 from a range of 633,000 kilometers (393,000 miles). Two oval cloud systems some 250 km. (150 mi.) across are visible at about 72 degrees north latitude. The bright spot in the center of the leftmost cloud is a convective cloud storm about 60 km. (37 mi.) across. The outer ring of material rotates in an anti-cyclonic sense (counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere). A similar cloud structure of comparable dimension appears at 55 degrees north (bottom center of this picture). These northern latitudes contain many bright, small-scale cloud spots--only a few tens of kilometers across--representative of convective cloud systems. Across the top of this image stretch several long, linear, wavelike features that may mark the northernmost east-flowing jet in Saturn's atmosphere. In this orange-and-violet-image composite, the smallest features visible are about 16 km. (10 mi.) across.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02226.jpg,1999-12-10
Two-image Mosaic of Saturn’s Rings,"This computer-assembled two-image mosaic of Saturn's rings, taken by NASA's Voyager 1 on Nov. 6, 1980 at a range of 8 million kilometers (5 million miles), shows approximately 95 individual concentric features in the rings. The extraordinarily complex structure of the rings is easily seen across the entire span of the ring system. The ring structure, once thought to be produced by the gravitational interaction between Saturn's satellites and the orbit of ring particles, has now been found to be too complex for this explanation alone.

Triton Mosaic,"This picture of Triton is a mosaic of the highest resolution images taken by Voyager 2 on Aug. 25, 1989 from a distance of about 40,000 kilometers (24,800 miles). The mosaic is superimposed on the lower resolution mapping images taken about 2 hours earlier in order to fill in gaps between high resolution images. The smallest features that can be seen on the images are about 0.8 kilometers (0.5 miles) across. The terminator (line separating day and night) is at the top of the picture and is centered at about 30 degrees north latitude and 330 degrees longitude. These highest resolution images were targeted for the terminator region to show details of the topography by the shadows it casts. Near the center of the picture is a depression filled with smooth plains that are probably ices which were once erupted in a fluid state. The depth of the depression is about 300 meters (900 feet) and the prominent fresh impact crater on its floor is about 20 kilometers (12 miles) in diameter and about 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) deep. On the right is an elongate crater with adjacent dark deposits above it. This feature may be an explosive eruption vent formed by gaps within the ice. The linear structure on the left is probably a fracture along which fresh ice has been extruded.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02235.jpg,1989-08-25
Triton’s Surface Topography,"Voyager 2 was 530,000 kilometers (330,000 miles) from Neptune's largest satellite, Triton, when this photo was taken, Aug. 24, 1989. With a resolution of 10 kilometers (6 miles), this is the first photo of Triton to reveal surface topography. The south pole, continuously illuminated by sunlight at this season, is at bottom left. The boundary between the bright southern hemisphere and the darker northern hemisphere is clearly visible. Both the darker regions to the north and the very bright sub-equatorial band show a complex pattern of irregular topography that somewhat resembles ""fretted terrain"" on parts of Venus and Mars. The pattern of dark and light regions over most of the southern hemisphere will require higher-resolution images for interpretation. Also evident are long, straight lines that appear to be surface expressions of internal, tectonic processes. No large impact craters are visible, suggesting that the crust of Triton has been renewed relatively recently that is, within the past billion years or less.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02234.jpg,1989-08-24
Voyager’s Color Image of Triton,"Features as small as 100 km (62 miles) across can be seen in this color image of Neptune's satellite Triton, photographed by Voyager 2 on Aug. 20, 1989, while it was still 5.4 million km (3.3 million miles) from Neptune. Triton's overall pinkish color may be due to reddish materials produced by irradiation of methane gas and ice on the satellite. The dark areas near the top of the image seem to be part of a belt of dark markings observed near Triton's equator at different longitudes. Generally, darker areas on Triton appear to be somewhat redder in color than brighter areas. The central longitude in the image is 123 degrees. Here the south pole is at about 6 o'clock, approximately one sixth of the way up from the bottom. The color image was made from three black and white frames, taken through clear, violet and green filters.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02246.jpg,1989-08-20
Voyager’s Parting Shot of Triton,"Voyager 2 obtained this parting shot of Triton, Neptune's largest satellite, shortly after closest approach to the moon and passage through its shadow on the morning of Aug. 25, 1989. The distance to Triton was 90,000 kilometers (56,000 thousand miles) and the phase angle was 155 degrees, so that only a thin crescent of Triton's south polar region can be seen. This image was assembled using the green, blue and violet filters of Voyager's wide angle camera. Because of the high phase angle, and perhaps because of scattering sunlight in Triton's hazy atmosphere, few surface features are discernible. Faint linear markings near the center of the crescent may be shadows case by surface features or by clouds, and the brightness of the left (western) horn of the crescent compared to the right horn may be a result of variable haze in the atmosphere.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02247.jpg,1989-08-25
Neptune’s Blue-green Atmosphere,"Neptune's blue-green atmosphere is shown in greater detail than ever before by the Voyager 2 spacecraft as it rapidly approaches its encounter with the giant planet. This color image, produced from a distance of about 16 million kilometers, shows several complex and puzzling atmospheric features. The Great Dark Spot (GDS) seen at the center is about 13,000 km by 6,600 km in size -- as large along its longer dimension as the Earth. The bright, wispy ""cirrus-type"" clouds seen hovering in the vicinity of the GDS are higher in altitude than the dark material of unknown origin which defines its boundaries. A thin veil often fills part of the GDS interior, as seen on the image. The bright cloud at the southern (lower) edge of the GDS measures about 1,000 km in its north-south extent. The small, bright cloud below the GDS, dubbed the ""scooter,"" rotates faster than the GDS, gaining about 30 degrees eastward (toward the right) in longitude every rotation. Bright streaks of cloud at the latitude of the GDS, the small clouds overlying it, and a dimly visible dark protrusion at its western end are examples of dynamic weather patterns on Neptune, which can change significantly on time scales of one rotation (about 18 hours).",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02245.jpg,2000-02-16
Io - Crescent with Plumes,"Voyager 2 took this picture of Io July 10, 1979, from a range of 1.2 million kilometers (750,000 miles). It was one of the last of an extensive sequence of ""volcano watch"" pictures planned as a time lapse study of the nearest of Jupiter's Galilean satellites. The sunlit crescent of Io is seen at the left, and the night side illuminated by light reflected from Jupiter can also be seen. Three volcanic eruption plumes are visible on the limb. All three were previously seen by Voyager 1. On the bright limb Plume 5 (upper) and Plume 6 (lower) are about 100 kilometers high, while Plume 2 on the dark limb is about 185 kilometers high and 325 kilometers wide. The dimensions of Plume 2 are about 1 1/2 times greater than during the Voyager 1 encounter, indicating that the intensity of the eruptions has increased during the four-month time interval between the Voyager encounters. The three volcanic eruptions and at least three others have apparently been active at roughly the same intensity or greater for a period of at least four months.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02254.jpg,1979-07-10
Callisto,"This black and white image of Callisto was taken by Voyager 2 about 3:20 A.M PDT Saturday, July 7, from a range of about 1.1 million kilometers (675,000 miles). The picture has been enhanced to reveal detail in the scene. Voyager l's high resolution coverage was of the hemisphere just over the right-hand (eastern) horizon, and the large ring structure discovered by Voyager 1 is just over the eastern limb. This image shows yet another ring structure in the upper part of the picture. Callisto exhibits some of the most ancient terrain seen on any of the satellites. Scientists think Callisto's surface is a mixture of ice and rock dating back to the final stages of planetary accretion (over 4 billion years ago) when the surface was pockmarked by a torrential bombardment of meteorites. Younger craters show as bright spots, probably because they expose fresh ice and frost.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02253.jpg,2000-04-24
Voyager 2 Jupiter Eruption Movie,"This movie records an eruptive event in the southern hemisphere of Jupiter over a period of 8 Jupiter days. Prior to the event, an undistinguished oval cloud mass cruised through the turbulent atmosphere. The eruption occurs over avery short time at the very center of the cloud. The white eruptive material is swirled about by the internal wind patterns of the cloud. As a result of the eruption, the cloud then becomes a type of feature seen elsewhere on Jupiter known as ""spaghetti bowls.""",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/animation/PIA02257,1979-05-06
Neptune: Ring Arcs,"The Voyager spacecraft was 8.6 million kilometers (5.3 million miles) from Neptune when it took this 61 second exposure through the clear filter with the narrow angle camera on August 19, 1989. The Voyager cameras were programmed to make a systematic search for faint ring arcs and new satellites. The bright upper corner of the image is due to a residual image from a previous long exposure of the planet. The portion of the arc visible here is approximately 35 degrees in longitudinal extent, making it approximately 38,000 kilometers (24,000 miles) in length, and is broken up into three segments separated from each other by approximately 5 degrees. The trailing edge is at the upper right and has an abrupt end while the leading edge seems to fade into the background more gradually. This arc orbits very close to one of the newly discovered Neptune satellites, 1989N4. Close-up studies of this ring arc will be carried out in the coming days which will give higher spatial resolution at different lighting angles.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02256.jpg,1989-08-19
Voyager 2 Movie of Saturn’s Moon: Phoebe,"Voyager 2 took this photo sequence of Saturn's outer satellite, Phoebe, on Sept. 4, 1981, from 2.2 million kilometers (1.36 million miles) away. The top image is the normal version and the bottom is an enhanced version to increase resolution. This sequence lasts 23.4 hours and contains 35 images. The early images were taken about 43 minutes apart, while the later ones are about 29 minutes apart. There are two significant gaps in the sequence: images 7 and 8 are separated by 2.3 hours and images 19 and 20 are separated by 2.8 hours.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/animation/PIA02260,1983-11-01
Tethys,"The Saturn satellite Tethys was viewed by Voyager 2 on Aug. 25 from a distance of 1 million kilometers (620,000 mi.). Evident on the surface of this icy moon is an enormous impact crater almost 400 km. (250 mi.) in diameter and about 15 km. (10 mi.) deep. Tethys itself is only 1,050 km. (650 mi.) in diameter. The crater contains a central peak about as high as the crater is deep; it is the result of rebound after the impact. Tethys resembles its sister satellite Mimas, seen closeup by Voyager 1 last fall. That body has a crater 130 km. (80 mi.) in diameter. The Tethys crater, which is so large that Mimas would fit inside, is on the opposite side of the great rift valley observed by Voyager 1. Many other, smaller craters pock-mark the surface here.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02276.jpg,2000-05-23
Saturn’s Rings - High Resolution,"Voyager 2 obtained this high-resolution picture of Saturn's rings Aug. 22, when the spacecraft was 4 million kilometers (2.5 million miles) away. Evident here are the numerous ""spoke"" features, in the B-ring; their very sharp, narrow appearance suggests short formation times. Scientists think electromagnetic forces are responsible in some way for these features, but no detailed theory has been worked out. Pictures such as this and analyses of Voyager 2's spoke movies may reveal more clues about the origins of these complex structures.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02275.jpg,2000-05-23
Saturn’s B-ring,"Prominent dark spokes are visible in the outer half of Saturn's broad B-ring in this Voyager 2 photograph taken on Aug. 3, 1981 from a range of about 22 million kilometers (14 million miles). The features appear as filamentary markings about 12,000 kilometers (7,S00 miles) long, which rotate around the planet with the motion of particles in the rings. The nature of these features, discovered by Voyager 1, is not totally understood, but scientists believe the spokes may be caused by dust levitated above the ring plane by electric fields; Voyager 2 photography of the rings edge-on, scheduled for Aug. 25, 1981, will provide an opportunity to test that theory. Because the Sun is now illuminating the rings from a higher angle, Voyager 2's photographs reveal ring structure from a greater distance than that seen by Voyager 1 in its November 1980 encounter.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02274.jpg,1981-08-03
Ganymede - Close Up Photos,"Two close-up photos of Ganymede, largest of Jupiter's 13 moons, were obtained on July 8 by Voyager 2 from 86,000 miles (top) and 192,000 miles. They show different views of the largest block of dark, heavily cratered terrain seen on the giant moon. The bottom image shows objects three to four miles across; has a resolution of about 1.5 miles. The light, linear stripes recurring across the dark region resemble the outer rings of the large ring structure on Callisto. If these features are in fact related to an ancient ring structure formed by a large impact, their small curvature suggests that the original structure was even larger than one seen on Callisto. There is no apparent trace now of the center of this suggested structure, which must have been destroyed by the resurfacing evident over most of Ganymede in the grooved terrain. Another interpretation is that these features are not impact-related rings but are internally produced fractures crossing the dark terrain, similar to the grooved bands.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02282.jpg,2000-05-25
Ganymede - Surface,"RIGHT: This picture shows part of the surface of Ganymede as viewed from a range-of 120,000 km by Voyager 2 on July 9th. In the foreground is typical grooved terrain as seen by Voyager 1. It consists of mutually intersecting bands of closely-spaced, parallel ridges and grooves. In the background is newly-cratered dark terrain across which can be traced several widely spaced parallel linear features. When viewed from a distance the line features appear to trace broad circular areas. The features resemble the circular ridges on Callisto that surround an almost completely annealed impact basin. The feature on Ganymede may be of similar origin but all traces of the impact itself have been destroyed. LEFT: This picture of Ganymede was taken at a range of 169,000 km by Voyager 2 on July 9th. Dark contrast terrain is separated by bright bands of grooved terrain. The band of closely spaced linear grooves in the foreground is 150 km across and appears to be offset by another narrow band at right angles, as though by faulting. A variety of ray patterns are seen around craters. One is the left of the picture, it has prominent dark rays around an inner bright halo. Other craters have dark haloes; other have diffuse bright rays. The variation is albedo patterns around the craters may be indications of layering in the surface materials. The intensity of craters suggests the dark areas are extremely old. The bright grooved terrain is less cratered and probably somewhat younger.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02281.jpg,2000-05-25
Titan,"This narrow-angle camera image of Titan was taken through the Clear filter from a distance of 0.9 million km on 25 August 1981. With a phase angle of 155 degrees, the thick atmosphere can be seen illuminated completely around the disk. A distinct upper haze layer is present over much of the circumference of the disk.",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA02290.jpg,1981-08-25
Ariel at Voyager Closest Approach,"This picture is part of the highest-resolution Voyager 2 imaging sequence of Ariel, a moon of Uranus about 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) in diameter. The clear-filter, narrow-angle image was taken Jan. 24, 1986, from a distance of 130,000 km (80,000 mi). The complexity of Ariel's surface indicates that a variety of geologic processes have occurred. The numerous craters, for example, are indications of an old surface bombarded by meteoroids over a long period. Also conspicuous at this resolution, about 2.4 km (1.5 mi), are linear grooves (evidence of tectonic activity that has broken up the surface) and smooth patches (indicative of deposition of material).",https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00037.jpg,1986-01-24

Three images, taken through ultraviolet, violet and green filters on July 12, 1981, were combined to make this photograph. Several changes are apparent in Saturn's atmosphere since Voyager 1's November 1980 encounter, and the planet's rings have brightened considerably due to the higher sun angle. Voyager 2 was 43 million kilometers (27 million miles) from Saturn when it took this photograph.
